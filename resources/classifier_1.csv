"On behalf of UNDP, I am honoured to speak at today’s opening ceremony of school tsunami drills campaign in Indonesia.","Disaster Management"
"The tsunami drills are part of a UNDP and Government of Japan project, BUT it is all of you here in Indonesia who have made them possible with your commitment and enthusiasm. I’d like to thank the school principals, faculty and administration, and of course the students for participating in this initiative. I’m also grateful for the presence of our partners – the Indonesian National Board for Disaster Management (NDMO), Ministry of National Education, the Consular General of Japan to Denpasar and the Red Cross – as this reaffirms your interest and engagement in this very important initiative.","Disaster Management"
"Indonesia is the first of 18 countries under this regional project, to plan and conduct the school drills. In my view, this is hardly surprising as this is the country in the Asia Pacific region that is a champion on Disaster Risk Reduction issues. As a country, you have turned the suffering that your people have faced into an opportunity to advocate for risk informed development, so that others will benefit. You know the importance of hazard risk for planning, for building and for growth. You have understood and embraced the importance of hazard awareness and preparedness so that the impact on the loss of lives and livelihoods is reduced.","Disaster Management"
"Today’s drills are part of your journey in ensuring that your most vulnerable, including children and those living in tsunami prone areas, are aware and prepared about how to respond in the event of a disaster. Lessons from the first drill will be shared with other countries in the region. There is much that they can learn from your experience and knowledge.  ","Disaster Management"
"The drills are not an end in themselves. They help test evacuation plans and improve preparedness. But you must conduct them regularly. Each year new students will enter your schools. Those who leave will take and spread their learning. Perhaps your students will become DRR experts in the future, or perhaps they will ensure that risk is integrated in the work they do. What better way to build a resilient future than building resilient generations?","Disaster Management"
"The moment students leave the school premises, the drills are no longer just about the school. The local administration, the traffic police, parents and the neighborhood – everyone becomes a part of this. The MOUs that you are signing this afternoon with eight hotels in the area show that even private enterprises play a role. What better way to build a whole of society approach than this?","Disaster Management"
"I’d like to conclude by saying how proud we are at UNDP to be supporting this initiative. We know that a lot of preparation has gone behind what we will observe today. And there’s much more to do. It is you who have the power to create a movement, a ripple effect of preparedness so that it’s not just a few schools and a few communities but that an entire nation is resilient.","Disaster Management"

"Solomon Islands - The first tsunami drill at schools in the Solomon Islands mobilized nearly 400 students and teachers, testing the schools’ emergency management plans and newly constructed evacuation routes.","Disaster Management"
"The tsunami evacuation drill was held in two schools - Titiana Community High School and Babanga Primary school, in the tsunami-prone Western Province. It was supported by the government of Solomon Islands and Japan, and the United Nations Development Program (UNDP).","Disaster Management"
"“During the 2007 Tsunami, 52 children and adults lost their lives. We did not know what a tsunami was or what to do. We are grateful for support of the Government of Japan and UNDP to help our communities and children to be better prepared for the future,” said Honorable George Lilo, member of the Provincial Assembly.","Disaster Management"
"The school tsunami preparedness project is supported by the Western Province Education Authority, Solomon Islands Red Cross-Gizo branch, the Seismology Division of MMERE and the NDMO, SI Meteorological Services, Climate Change Division of the Ministry of Environment, Climate Change and Disaster Management & Meteorology.","Disaster Management"
"Using images taken from the drones and stories gathered from the communities, the agencies in collaborations with the two schools banded together to collect data, and conduct a tsunami risk assessment. They also produced tsunami hazard maps, and identified evacuation routes and safe areas.","Disaster Management"
"The work resulted in the creation of new emergency evacuation plans, and construction of evacuation routes.","Disaster Management"
"It was recommended that schools set up internal siren systems to support early warning, build emergency exit doors, and display tsunami evacuation guides around the perimeter of the schools’ campus to ensure safe evacuation.","Disaster Management"
" “Our children have a lot to learn about being safe and being able to fend for themselves when threats exist. Children are “agents of change”, they will carry the safety message to their parents, friends, and entire community,” said  Director of the National Disaster Management Office, Mr. Loti Yates.","Disaster Management"
"UNDP Country Manager in the Solomon Islands, Ms Azusa Kubota, thanked the Government of Solomon Islands and Government of Japan for partnering with UNDP in this important initiative.","Disaster Management"
"“Globally, schools have been identified as an ideal venue for raising awareness on disaster risk reduction and strengthening preparedness amongst students, families and communities. It is wonderful to see not only school children and teachers, but also community members coming together to be part of today’s exercise,” said Ms. Azusa Kubota of UNDP","Disaster Management"
"With support from the government of Japan, UNDP is organizing 90 tsunami evacuation drills in 18 countries across Asia and the Pacific. The regional project “Strengthening School Preparedness for Tsunami” is active in Bangladesh, Cambodia, Fiji, Indonesia, Malaysia, Maldives, Myanmar, Pakistan, Papua New Guinea, Philippines, Samoa, Solomon Islands, Sri Lanka, Thailand, Timor Leste, Tonga, Vanuatu, and Vietnam.","Disaster Management"

"**NEW YORK, November 2, 2017** - Czech model and entrepreneur Petra Nemcova was yesterday officially recognized by Robert Glasser, Special Representative of the Secretary-General for Disaster Risk Reduction as World Tsunami Awareness Advocate in a ceremony held at the Japan Society in New York. ","Disaster Management"
"“Petra Nemcova not only survived the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami in Thailand under terrible circumstances but also found a way to continue living, sharing her experience and putting her entrepreneurial spirit at the service of people affected by disasters. We are very pleased to recognize her efforts and acknowledge the incredible work she has undertaken to increase awareness on tsunami risk” said Robert Glasser. ","Disaster Management"
"On 26 December 2004, Petra Nemcova lost her fiancé Simon Atlee and suffered serious injuries when the Indian Ocean earthquake and subsequent tsunami struck in Thailand. She managed to survive holding on to a palm tree for eight hours until she was rescued by Thai civilians and airlifted to an inland hospital nearby. ","Disaster Management"
"“I was blessed to survive a near death experience in 2004 and this experience has taught me a huge lesson. We cannot control nature, but we can control the actions we take,” she says. ","Disaster Management"
"A few months after the Indian Ocean tsunami, Petra went back to Thailand and created “Happy Hearts Fund.” Her charity fund has now financed 165 safe and disaster resilient schools in disaster-affected communities in Peru, Mexico, Chile, Colombia, Haiti, Thailand, Indonesia, Philippines and Nepal to the benefit of over 100,000 children. ","Disaster Management"
"“We make sure that our schools respect the national building codes and are able to withstand a major earthquake, tsunami, or hurricane reinforcing their structure with steel bars along vulnerable and critical joints which allow them to withstand stronger forces,” she confirms. ","Disaster Management"
"Petra Nemcova who describes herself today as a model, philanthropist and entrepreneur admits to spending more than two third of her time raising money and rebuilding schools in disaster-affected countries. ","Disaster Management"
"“Last week, we were in Nepal, and we have just reopened five schools which were completely damaged after the 2015 earthquake. We are also involved in the reconstruction of five schools in Saint Martin and the rest of the Caribbean after hurricane Harvey hit the region.” ","Disaster Management"
"“I thank UNISDR for designating me as tsunami advocate which I accept with a great honor, and I will continue working on raising awareness on tsunami risks but my action today goes beyond tsunami prevention as I do believe that we can only save more lives in the future if we have a multi-hazard approach.” ","Disaster Management"
"The event at the Japan Society was co-organized by the permanent mission of Japan to the United Nations in New York, as well as the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) and the United Nations Office for Disaster Risk Reduction (UNISDR). ","Disaster Management"
"The recognition of Petra Nemcova was announced after the opening remarks of Ambassador Koro Bessho, Permanent Representative of Japan followed by the interventions of Mr. František Ružička, Chef de Cabinet to the President of the 72nd Session of the UN General Assembly and Mr. Achim Steiner, Administrator of UNDP , who stressed the importance of integrating tsunami education in the curriculum of all children to better protect communities and to have more efficient early warning systems in place to save more lives in the future.","Disaster Management"

"The United Nations Platform for Space-based Information for Disaster Management and Emergency Response (UN-SPIDER) has published a new booklet with examples of the programme's technical advisory support activities.","Disaster Management"
"UN-SPIDER was established in 2006 based on the recognition that disaster risk management and emergency response communities, particularly in emerging countries, were not fully utilizing space-based technology. To support countries in institutionalizing the use of space-based information in all phases of disaster management, UN-SPIDER regularly carries out advisory support activities upon the invitation of a United Nations Member State.","Disaster Management"
"The booklet outlines the advisory support the programme has provided to three Member States: Myanmar, the Dominican Republic and Sri Lanka.","Disaster Management"
"In a first step, UN-SPIDER undertook a one-week-long Technical Advisory Mission (TAM) to each of these countries. Accompanied by a group of experts, it assessed the current use of space-based information in disaster management activities based on exchanges with disaster management and development authorities, United Nations organizations, regional and international organizations as well as private sector entities. Since its establishment in 2006, the programme has conducted 35 such missions. At the end of a TAM, UN-SPIDER makes recommendations to the Member State in areas such as policy and coordination, capacity building and institutional strengthening, and accessing and processing of data.","Disaster Management"
"UN-SPIDER typically conducts a number of follow-up activities after a TAM, which can take a variety of forms such as stakeholder meetings, workshops or training sessions. In Sri Lanka, for instance, UN-SPIDER conducted four trainings on topics such as ""Space Technology for Improving Hazard Mapping"" and ""Earth Observation Technologies for Flood Risk Mapping, Modelling and Management"" following its TAM in 2011. It also worked together with the Disaster Management Centre (DMC) of Sri Lanka to support it in becoming an Authorized User of the International Charter ""Space and Major Disasters"" in 2017. For the its activation for latest floods in the country in May 2018, the Charter nominated the DMC as project manager.","Disaster Management"
"In the Dominican Republic, UN-SPIDER's 2010 TAM was followed by an Institional Strengthening Mission (ISM) to elaborate the terms of reference for the Inter-institutional Geospatial Information Team (EIGEO), which was established in 2013. The EIGEO team brings together professionals from 14 ministries, government agencies, universities and NGOs who have been trained by UN-SPIDER in the use of geographic information systems (GIS) and remote sensing applications. In 2017, the International Charter nominated the team as project manager for its activation for Hurricane Irma.","Disaster Management"
"In its advisory support activities, UN-SPIDER draws on the expertise of its network of 22 Regional Support Offices (RSOs). Argentina's National Commission on Space Activities (CONAE), for instance, conducted a training for the EIGEO team in the Dominican Republic, which was facilitated by UN-SPIDER. Regional Support Offices, such as the International Water Management Institute (IWMI) in Sri Lanka, have also worked closely together with local disaster management authorities to respond to emergency situations. By making their expertise available for UN-SPIDER activities, RSOs support the programme in implementing its mandate. Through a country-based perspective on UN-SPIDER's activities, the booklet highlights how long-term engagement with relevant stakeholders in a Member State can facilitate the institutionalization of the use of space-based information in disaster management while strengthening technical capacity and ensuring the state has access to existing international emergency reponse mechanisms.","Disaster Management"

"2nd November, 2017 Weather Forecasting Staff of the National Weather Forecasting Office are receiving much needed high resolution modeling from the Indonesian Meteorological Service (BMKG). At a one day training session held at the Tanoa Dateline Hotel the Director of the Tonga Meteorological Service, Mr. ‘Ofa Fa’anunu gave a short brief of the assistance. “The project we are implementing here in Tonga since last week and completing this week is assistance being provided by our Indonesian counterparts to 5 Pacific Island Countries namely Tonga, Vanuatu, Solomon Islands, Samoa and Fiji through funding from the UNESCAP. Tonga is the first country to implement the project. Two specialists from the Indonesian Weather Service (BMKG) are here to assist us install and run a high resolution model at the Forecasting Centre at Fua’amotu. The 2 experts include Chief of the Forecasting Centre in Indonesia, Mr. Agie Wandala Putra and Systems Administrator, Mr. Zainal Abidin.”","Disaster Management"
"Fa’anunu added, ”One of the forecasting difficulties we have today in Tonga is the forecasting of heavy rain. Especially heavy rain associated with thunderstorms and heavy rain associated with low pressure systems which usually gives intense rainfall and problems of flooding of low lying areas in Tonga. Improving forecast of heavy rainfall events will assist us with our response and readiness for such events.","Disaster Management"
"Starting last week these experts from Indonesia have helped us parameterize and install the high resolution Weather Research and Forecast (WRF) model for Tonga. This model downscales the global weather model we use for forecasting here in Tonga called the GFS model (22km resolution) down to 7km and 2.3km resolution.","Disaster Management"
"In plane language its like zooming down from looking at rainfall amount over a 22km area to just 7km and 2.3km areas. We expect that this project will improve our forecasting of high rainfall intensity events.","Disaster Management"
"Finally, The Director of Meteorology wanted to thanks the development partners for their Assistance. “ I would like to take this opportunity to thank the Indonesian Government through the BMKG as well as UNESCAP for this timely and significant assistance to Tonga. We expect that the project will make vast improvements to our Early Warning System and in building community resilience to extreme rainfall events”","Disaster Management"

"Following are UN Deputy Secretary-General Amina Mohammed’s remarks on building resilience to natural hazards, including tsunamis, and the need to reduce disaster risk for the Sustainable Development Goals, as prepared for delivery in New York today:","Disaster Management"
"I thank the Government of Japan and my colleagues at UNISDR [United Nations Office for Disaster Risk Reduction] and UNDP [United Nations Development Programme] for organizing this important discussion.","Disaster Management"
"This year in the Caribbean and on the American mainland, hurricanes have left millions of people in need of assistance.  The Secretary-General recently travelled to Antigua and Barbuda and Dominica to show solidarity and see for himself the damage.","Disaster Management"
"In Puerto Rico, 3.4 million people have been scrambling for basic necessities, including food and water.  Barbuda was rendered uninhabitable and Dominica was hit hard for the second year in a row.  Across the globe, floods in Bangladesh, India and Nepal have affected some 40 million people.  Twenty countries have also declared drought emergencies in the past 18 months, with major displacement taking place across the Horn of Africa.","Disaster Management"
"In light of such impacts, and the growing influence of climate change, which is increasingly exacerbating them, one conclusion is clear: sustainable development and the achievement of the SDGs [Sustainable Development Goals] will remain elusive or significantly delayed so long as hazards are left unchecked.","Disaster Management"
"It is difficult to maintain social and economic progress if development gains are so regularly and profoundly wiped out.  Clearly, more must be done.  We need to build a new generation of infrastructure that is risk-informed, and that in turn underpins resilient economies, communities and livelihoods.  We must also rebuild differently, and better.","Disaster Management"
"This is not a new suggestion.  For years, the international community has called for the need to invest in disaster risk reduction.  As outlined in the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction, we need to shift from managing disasters to preventing disasters by better managing existing risks.  This means tackling risk drivers such as poverty, rapid urbanization, weak governance, the decline of ecosystems, desertification and climate change.  These are all driving up disaster risk around the world.","Disaster Management"
"It also means investing appropriately in structural and non-structural measures to prevent and prepare for worst-case scenarios.  In this area, we have seen some success.  Thanks to the efforts of Member States, supported by the United Nations and other development partners, there has been a decline in mortality in relation to most natural hazards in recent years, particularly storms and floods.  In places where strong building codes are observed there has been a decline in mortality from earthquakes.","Disaster Management"
"Most countries make efforts to educate and inform children about disaster risk.  One major life-saving measure to emerge from the devastating 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami was the region’s Tsunami Warning System.  This now provides alerts through three regional watch centres in India, Indonesia and Australia, and a network of 26 national tsunami information centres.","Disaster Management"
"It is an efficient system which disseminated early warnings within eight minutes of the Banda Aceh earthquake in 2012.  There are also now tsunami early-warning systems in place for the Caribbean and the North-East Atlantic, Mediterranean and connecting seas to match the system that has long been available in the Pacific.","Disaster Management"
"As we celebrate this progress, it is also important to remember that warnings are not always enough.  The Sendai Framework reminds us that a key element in reducing the number of people affected must be education and information.  We must ensure that people are well-informed and well prepared to take the necessary action.","Disaster Management"
"For that reason, I welcome the work of the United Nations, undertaken with support from Japan, to boost tsunami-awareness throughout the Asia-Pacific region.  By working with local officials across 18 countries, in particular with school children, the programme is helping to increase knowledge of risks, to prepare evacuation plans, and to hold tsunami drills.  Together, this is leading to concrete and practical results that will undoubtedly help save lives.","Disaster Management"
"As we look ahead, it is important that we build on the work undertaken by Governments, the United Nations and partners to boost awareness of tsunami and other risks.  Increased access to information and the ability to anticipate and absorb risk must become the norm, not the exception.  The United Nations system is committed to delivering on this task.","Disaster Management"
"Let us reflect on the lessons that have brought us here today and the impacts that have been so deeply felt by some of the world’s most vulnerable people.  Let us recognize progress and commit ourselves to investing the resources needed to protect people and development gains.","Disaster Management"

"Since its establishment in 2011, Kampala Capital City Authority (KCCA) has upgraded a number of drainage channels to divert floods. However, the problem seems far from over.","Disaster Management"
"Dr Najib Lukooya Bateganya, the KCCA director for environment and sanitation, says although there are primary drainage channels in place, these need to be complemented with secondary drainages to reduce the volume of water that is accommodated by the former.","Disaster Management"
"“The problem is that we have the main drainages, which are at times overpowered by the heavy run-off waters. These main channels such as Nakivubo ought to be helped by the small drainages to ease the flow. What we are now doing is upgrading more drainages to help the main ones, so that we can get rid of the problem of persistent flooding,” he says.","Disaster Management"
"However, Dr Bateganya notes that the public has always let down KCCA in its bid to fight flooding because they dump waste in the drainages, which triggers backflow of water.","Disaster Management"
"“That has been our biggest challenge as authorities because the public hasn’t complied with regulations. For instance, when you walk around, you will see plastics and other waste dumped in drainages, which is very absurd,” he says.","Disaster Management"

"Dr Bateganya further attributes the flooding challenges in Kampala to encroachment on wetlands, which, he says, are supposed to be catchment areas.","Disaster Management"
"Currently, many factories and houses have been built in wetlands despite the existing law. But authorities at times just look on because some developers wield much influence and are connected to the powers that be.","Disaster Management"
"But Mr Emmanuel Sserunjogi, the Kawempe Division mayor, says although KCCA contracted concessioners to manage waste in Kampala, they do not have the capacity to do so because of the high number of tonnes of garbage produced in the entire city.","Disaster Management"
"A statutory audit report released by Mr Moses Bwire, the KCCA director for internal audit, poked holes in the operations of the contracted garbage collection companies over incompetence. ","Disaster Management"
"This implies that residents are compelled to dump garbage anywhere because the services are hardly accessible.","Disaster Management"
"To reduce flooding, Mr Sserunjogi reveals that he has embarked on a campaign in the entire division to clean all the drainage channels to allow easy flow of water during the rainy season.","Disaster Management"
"“This is a big problem which we must collectively fight because it tarnishes the image of Kampala city. The situation is always appalling shortly after the downpour, hence exposing residents to danger. I call upon my fellow leaders to mobile, sensitise and take part in cleaning all places that block water flow,” he says.","Disaster Management"
"The lowland areas of Kampala, coupled with the poor quality soils to absorb water, Dr Bateganya says, make the city susceptible to flooding.","Disaster Management"
"Dr Amin Tamale Kiggundu, a lecturer of planning and urban development at Makerere University, says flooding is linked to climate change and changing weather patterns.","Disaster Management"
"But he attributes flooding in the city to most settlements that have been established in areas that were once wetlands or swamps. Flooding becomes inevitable whenever it rains. To mitigate this calamity, Dr Kiggundu says Kampala needs a good storm water management system, which should focus on preserving critical green spaces such as Centenary Park, protecting the wetlands from encroachment and fostering plans that aim to harvest rain water.","Disaster Management"
"“The building laws in the city need to change by forcing developers to leave some portion of their land unpaved so that water can just be absorbed without necessarily flowing,” he says.","Disaster Management"
"While addressing journalists on the status of city roads last week, Mr Andrew Kitaka, the KCCA director of engineering and technical services, revealed that upgrading of Kampala’s drainage channels is yet to start.","Disaster Management"
"“The study for updating of the drainage master plan for Kampala was completed in 2017. This study has provided valuable information for the planning of the required improvement of Kampala’s drainage system, the locations and extents flood prone areas as well as guidance on mitigation measures for reduction of surface run off among others,” Eng Kitaka said.","Disaster Management"
"He noted that the upgrade of these drainage channels had stalled because there was no any study on which KCCA would base on to commence construction works.","Disaster Management"

"Dhaka is the cultural, political, and financial center of Bangladesh. It is one of the largest and most densely populated cities in South Asia, with a population of approximately 17.5 million people in 2015 and growing at the rate of over 3 percent per year (World Bank 2015). By 2025, the United Nations (UN) predicts Dhaka will be home to more than 20 million people—a population larger than that of Mexico City, Beijing, or Shanghai. It is estimated that almost 34,000 people inhabit each square kilometer of the city, yielding a population density that is among the highest in the world (Dasgupta et al. 2015). The city contributes about 34 percent of the country’s gross domestic product (GDP), indicating its economic and strategic importance. ","Disaster Management"
"Dhaka is highly prone to water-related hazards such as urban and river flooding, owing to its location, topography, climate, and proximity to rivers. It experiences major floods regularly, as in 1954, 1955, 1962, 1966, 1974, 1987, 1988, 1998, 2004, and 2009. Situated in the lower reaches of the Ganga delta, the Dhaka Metropolitan Area (DMA) is surrounded by rivers and tributaries: the Buriganga to the south, Turag to the west, Tongi Khal to the north, and the Balu-Shitalakhya to the east. The city is low lying, with an elevation that varies from 0.8 to 14 meters above mean sea level, and is drained by numerous natural waterways and canals.","Disaster Management"
"Dhaka is also among the most climate-vulnerable megacities in the world (Maplecroft 2013). Climate variability and change are expected to intensify the city’s exposure to environmental risk and heighten the extent and duration of urban flooding and inundation. With rapid and unplanned urbanization, the vulnerability of the city, and particularly of its poorest residents is likely to increase unless measures to ensure resilience are put in place. During the 1998 floods, most of eastern Dhaka and some parts of western Dhaka were inundated for almost 65 days. The impact of flooding is widespread: it compromises the sewerage system, degrades drinking water, disrupts traffic, and increases the incidence of water-borne diseases. While city-level cost estimates of the damage from extreme floods are scarce, one study estimates the damage from the 1998 floods at approximately $171 million.","Disaster Management"
"At present, Dhaka is at a crossroads of development. The main planning agency, Rajdhani Unnayan Kartripakkha (Capital Development Authority, RAJUK) is drafting a Structure Plan (2016–35) for the next 20 years. The design and implementation of this plan will shape infrastructure development and the pattern of urbanization in the city for decades to come. The emerging plans and their implementation will also affect management of the city’s water and ecological resources, influx of rural migrants into the city, supply of jobs and affordable housing, and adaptation to climate risks. ","Disaster Management"
"Management of flood risks is a critical part of this story. As the city urbanizes, it is imperative that it builds on lessons of the past so that flood risks are fully integrated into urban planning and managed effectively. Although there is an extensive literature on Dhaka’s urbanization, flood risk management, and poverty, few studies have assessed the historical drivers of the city’s decision making with respect to flood risk management, linkages between urban planning and flood risk, or the political-economic and institutional issues constraining improved flood and urban resilience. This study aims to fill this gap.","Disaster Management"

"- Africa’s first-ever ministerial level Meteorology Hydromet Forum formally recognizes the role hydromet services play in development.  ","Disaster Management"
"- Investing in hydromet, or weather, water, and climate services, reduces the risk an economy faces from natural disasters and climate change.","Disaster Management"
"“Hydromet” or weather, water, and climate services affect the decisions people, communities, and governments make every day. A family at their farm, a shopkeeper in a store, or a government worker on a dam, all need accurate, timely information to make well-informed day-to-day decisions. This can come from something as simple a river gauge, which warns of rising water levels, to more advanced weather forecasting systems alerting an entire country of the approach of a cyclone.","Disaster Management"
"Disasters related to weather, water, and climate badly affect communities and cause billions of US dollars in economic losses every year. Globally, hard-fought development gains are placed at risk. Add the consequences of climate change, and such losses could increase.","Disaster Management"
"Africa has the world’s least developed weather, water, and climate observation network, with less than 300 of its weather stations meeting the World Meteorological Organization’s (WMO’s) observation standards. As much as 54 per cent of its surface weather stations, and 71 per cent of its upper-air weather stations, do not report accurate data. Budgets to maintain key infrastructure run short each year, and the cost of modernization investment needed amounts to more than US$1.5 billion.","Disaster Management"
"These costs can be eased, however, or effectively offset. Countries can save US$13 billion in asset losses annually by investing in hydromet, as well as saving US$22 billion in losses to well-being, and US$30 billion through a resulting increase in productivity.","Disaster Management"
"**Investing in hydromet creates savings**","Disaster Management"
"Overall, every US dollar (or its equivalent) invested in hydromet services has the potential to generate at least three dollars’ worth of benefits. Plus, being able to understand, predict, and warn citizens about natural hazards and disasters drives the ability of governments to reduce economic risks and save lives.","Disaster Management"
"Advancements in hydromet services also generate economic growth.","Disaster Management"
"Put simply, farmers who know when it will rain can avoid having fertilizer washed away, or move livestock to high ground before flooding. Fishermen with reliable information can avoid risking their lives at sea and improve efficiency on their boats. Transporters can prevent the unsafe movement of people and goods during heavy storms by using early warning systems.","Disaster Management"
"The World Bank and the [Global Facility for Disaster Reduction and Recovery (GFDRR)](https://www.gfdrr.org/) worked with governments and other partners to form the Africa Hydromet Program, which supports the national and regional modernization of hydromet services. This initiative is raising US$600 million in funding to modernize old forecast technologies and build new ones. The program will make weather data more accessible and give officials and other decision makers the opportunity to better provide better weather prediction services for their citizens.","Disaster Management"
"In the Democratic Republic of the Congo, for example, better hydromet services are helping communities deal with everything from volcanic eruptions to floods.","Disaster Management"

"Mount Agung’s rumbling may or may not portend a massive eruption on the scale of a century. Fortunately the probability this time is for great disruption to air traffic, tourism, and the local economy, rather than massive death and homelessness.","Disaster Management"
"But among the constant eruptions of Indonesia’s many volcanoes (66 currently being monitored, with [50–60 more considered “active”](http://volcano.si.edu/region.cfm?rn=6)), huge ones will come. They will be enormously destructive to Indonesia, will impact the world’s climate, and will challenge Australia’s capacity to manage without air traffic while assisting millions of displaced Indonesians to survive and recover. Even the moderate ones that are likely to occur every decade, causing dislocations to hundreds of thousands, need to be prepared for in a systematic way.","Disaster Management"
"The truth is that the chain of volcanoes in the Sunda Islands of Indonesia, from Sumatra through Java and Bali to Timor, constitutes the most dangerous of the world’s tectonic interfaces [_see map below_].  ","Disaster Management"
"The northward-moving Australian plate thrusts under this chain at a rate of about 6cm a year, gradually curling downward the southern coasts of the Sunda chain until that pressure is released as the outer coast springs back upward. This causes a massive earthquake in each sector, or subduction zone, as the outer crust of the plate springs up by as much as 5 metres. The 9.2 magnitude quake of December 2004 at the northwestern end of this chain was the wakeup call. It triggered the “Indian Ocean” tsunami that killed nearly 200,000 people in Sumatra and thousands more around that ocean’s shores.","Disaster Management"
"The geologists went seriously to work on Sumatra after this crisis, and have now demonstrated a 7,000 year series of previous mega-events generating tsunamis, occurring irregularly [but on an average once in 450 years](https://www.nature.com/articles/ncomms16019).  ","Disaster Management"
"Nobody has done this kind of sophisticated geoscience elsewhere in Indonesia, and less still in the Nicobars—the other centre of the 2004 quake—where an over-sensitive Indian government has continued to exclude foreign aid workers and researchers. But the existing historical record makes clear that events at least as big have occurred repeatedly along this chain and as far as the Solomons. The great naturalist Rumphius survived [a tsunami in Ambon in 1674](http://iotic.ioc-unesco.org/1950ambontsunami/additional-notes/16/1674-tsunami-in-ambon-and-seram) that may have been the world’s highest wave ever described, at around 100 metres.","Disaster Management"
"How does this pattern of subduction and release at the world’s most dangerous tectonic interface affect the eruption of the volcanoes that are its most spectacularly visible demonstration? So far, the science has to say, “it’s very complicated”. The periodicity of mega-eruptions is one of the great unknowns. But Indonesia has such a major share of the world’s dangerous volcanoes that recurrence somewhere is inevitable.","Disaster Management"
"The VEI of Table 1 refers to the logarithmic Volcanic Explosivity Index, whereby a mighty 7 (like Tambora) throws out over 100km of volcanic material, 10 times that of a VEI 6 (like Krakatau) which in turn ejects 10 times more than a 5 (like Gunung Agung in 1963).","Disaster Management"
"Perhaps it may be comforting for those awaiting catastrophe in Bali that the biggest explosive eruptions we know much about, Tambora in 1815 and Krakatau in 1883, appear to have occurred where there was not a prior record of regular eruptions every decade or two, or even the three in two centuries (1808, 1843, 1963) we know for Agung. Merapi, clearly visible from Yogyakarta and Surakarta and central to the mythology of these traditional Javanese capitals, is the best-known example of a “manageable” volcano with frequent eruptions. It has sent lava flows down the mountain towards the cities every decade or so, without killing more than a few hundred unlucky souls or displacing more than a few thousand. Kelut and Galunggang have been a little less frequent but more murderous, whereas Tambora had no known precedents.","Disaster Management"
"The precedent everybody in Bali is very well aware of is Mount Agung’s eruption of 1963, which occurred at an exceptionally traumatic time for Bali. The economy was close to a century-long nadir as a result of the prolonged crisis of Indonesia’s transition to independence and Sukarno’s confronting, rather than encouraging, foreign investment and aid. Political polarisation was intense. The Left in Bali saw destruction of the privileges of the upper-caste _triwangsa_ and the remaining influence of the island’s rajas as a necessary part of Indonesia’s unfinished revolution. Traditionalists believed that would mean the end of Bali’s unique civilisation. The priests decided they needed to cleanse Bali through a massive Eka Dasa Rudra ritual, last held in the nineteenth century. Though designed specifically to appease the powerful spiritual forces of the volcano, it failed spectacularly to do so. Many of those engaged in making offerings at the crater were among those killed as it erupted.","Disaster Management"
"The series of eruptions, most severe on 17 March and 16 May 1963, left Bali in misery. Some 1,580 people were reported killed by the rapid lava flows and accompanying poisonous gases. If a comparable eruption occurred tomorrow, the death toll would be greatly lessened by the warning systems now in place and the much better communication and support systems to get people out. The most impressive example of a major Southeast Asian eruption where the immediate deaths were relatively few was Pinatubo, close to population centres in Luzon,  ","Disaster Management"
"Philippines. Some 100,000 were successfully evacuated before the eruption, the worst in our region in the past half-century. Pinatubo cooperated with the geologists by gradually increasing the intensity of its rumbling, making the warnings believable to an always reluctant-to-move population.","Disaster Management"
"Bali in 1963 was in no such state. Nor did it have the resources or organisation to cope with the terrible aftermath. Sukarno, embarking on his “Confrontation” of Malaysia, sought no international aid and discouraged publicity. The eruptions were estimated to have destroyed some 50,000 to 62,000 hectares of farmland, a fifth of which was irrigated riceland which had supported over 100,000 people. Livestock were decimated, with 3,467 cattle and 5,858 pigs lost, the basis of many livelihoods in worst-hit Karangasem. Governor Suteja said in April that, “We have to feed 85,000 refugees and we simply do not have the food to do it.” Reports of malnutrition and death from starvation became widespread in the local press, [though downplayed in national media wanting to show Bali as](https://books.google.com.au/books?id=m3Gfir3Ju70C&source=gbs_book_other_versions) harmonious.","Disaster Management"
"How great the longer-term effect of this destruction of livelihoods was on Bali’s population is difficult to assess. In earlier times, destruction of agriculture in this intensive rice-growing area meant death by starvation, unless escaping through bondage to some less devastated place. Bali in 1963 did in principle have a country behind it, but the circumstances of the time meant little aid was forthcoming.","Disaster Management"
"The best way to calculate the 1963 eruption’s effect on Bali’s population should be the two national censuses of 1961 and 1971, Indonesia’s first as an independent country. These have many shortcomings, but do provide the broad outlines. Indonesia’s population as a whole grew by 2.08% per annum between the two censuses, whereas Bali’s population grew by only 0.75%. There was therefore a “missing” population of 67,000 that would have been expected if Bali was more “normal” in this period.","Disaster Management"
"The situation was complicated by a second phenomenon between the two censuses that may have made Bali abnormal. The political killings of communists and other leftists in 1965–6 are also thought to have impacted Bali more than Indonesia as a whole. Though nobody knows the numbers, estimates as high as 100,000 have become current for the number of victims in Bali.","Disaster Management"
"The regional dispersion of the “missing” population at the 1971 census data appears to show, however, that the eruption of Agung was a much bigger factor. All the loss of normal population growth was in the eastern kabupaten of Karangasem (the site of the volcano) and its neighbours Bangli and Klungkung. On the other hand, the massacre of Leftists was understood to be mainly in the west of the island. The three districts of Jembrana, Buleleng, and Gianyar were all headed by bupati (regents) from the PKI (the Indonesian Communist Party) or its ally Partindo, and leftist activism had been concentrated there. In these western districts population growth between 1961 and 1971 was above the Bali average.","Disaster Management"
"Population flight from east to west after the eruption may have masked the demographic effect of killings in the west to some extent. Nevertheless the eruption was a much bigger factor in Bali’s excess mortality in the 1960s than has been acknowledged.","Disaster Management"
"The twentieth century, when seismography and tectonic theory began to make possible a modern scientific understanding of earthquakes and eruptions, was a relatively “mild” one for Indonesia geologically. The twenty-first century has in its first decade already far exceeded the number of casualties from geological disasters in the whole twentieth century. In the nineteenth, the two eruptions of Tambora (1815) and Krakatau (1883) both far exceeded anything known in the twentieth.","Disaster Management"
"In that “mild” century Indonesia’s population grew five-fold from 40 to 205 million, despite one of the world’s more successful birth control policies after 1970. When population data began to be systematically collected around 1820, Indonesia’s population was strikingly low in comparison with India, China, Japan or Europe. This was despite having among the more benign climates and most fertile soils in the world, and a population history going back tens of thousands of years. Bali, with an estimated 600,000 people in 1600, appeared to have grown hardly at all by 1820. The reality, it now appears, is that Indonesia’s population growth must have been very uneven, with high growth in many periods interrupted not only by wars, but also by effects on agriculture of massive eruptions like that of Tambora.","Disaster Management"
"Only recently have the dots been connected to show the major effects of Tambora’s 1815 eruption on world climate. A “year without summer” followed the eruption in the northern hemisphere in 1816, with crop failures and famines in Europe, North America, and China. Tambora’s effects on our own region are far less well known.","Disaster Management"
"The indigenous population of northern Australia, who must have heard the explosion and seen some of the ash effects, were not taking notes.  ","Disaster Management"
"We do know, however, that the ash—which fell not only on Sumbawa itself but the neighbouring islands to the west, Lombok and Bali—caused the destruction of agriculture in the year that followed, and a massive loss of population. A Dutch observer counted 34 corpses of people trying to escape starvation along a 25km stretch of track between Badung and Gianyar in 1818. Bali exported nothing in the decade that followed except slaves, desperate to escape starvation by selling themselves to the slave traders. Yet 25 years later it was restored and flourishing with the beneficial fertilising effects of the ash fall, exporting large amounts of rice to Singapore and elsewhere.","Disaster Management"
"Only in 2013 were the [scientific and historical dots joined](http://centaur.reading.ac.uk/68817/1/Guillet_et_al_1257_1258_Nature_Geoscience_Format_Final.pdf) to show that the source of another huge disruption of global climate in 1258 was caused by a massive eruption on Bali’s neighbour to the east,  ","Disaster Management"
"Lombok, the previous year. This was another VEI 7, with greater emissions than Tambora, and therefore something the contemporary world of scientific measurement has not yet had to deal with directly.  ","Disaster Management"
"Although the effects on the northern hemisphere have again been traced with far greater care than those in our own neighbourhood, it seems clear that Bali experienced another devastation from this closer eruption. There is a significant thirteenth century gap in the Balinese dated inscriptions that are the most reliable means of historical dating. Balinese and Lombok chronicles of later date suggest that a nascent Lombok civilisation was destroyed about this time, and that Bali was at such a low ebb that the first of the series of colonisations from Java’s Majapahit (on various readings dated 1262 or 1284) encountered little resistance.","Disaster Management"
"**How will the future differ from the past?**","Disaster Management"
"Today the populations exposed to the effects of any repetition of a Tambora-sized eruption have increased many-fold, and become about 50% urban. This population is no longer directly dependent on its own crops for survival. Trade and aid should spare the immediately affected region from famine resulting from the destruction of local crops. Governments today believe it is their responsibility to ensure the survival of populations so threatened, and to a great extent have the resources to do so. As the 2004 tsunami disaster showed, the world is capable of great generosity in contributing to the process of disaster relief and reconstruction, especially in a place like Bali that is familiar to the world’s tourists.","Disaster Management"
"Tourism to Bali had begun in the 1920s, but only a tiny handful of mostly Jakarta-based visitors were coming at the time of the 1963 eruption. Bali’s international airport was not opened until 1968, after which the mass traffic built up to the four million a year who visit today. This vast expansion will be fundamentally positive in helping Bali to respond to a really major eruption. Bali’s infrastructure is now exceptionally good, and the thousands of hotels could be turned to emergency purposes when foreign tourists stopped coming. International sympathy and media attention could be expected to be good for Bali, and one hopes that would serve as a stimulus for aid organisations to assist the exceptionally under-developed and vulnerable islands to its east—Sumbawa, Flores, and Timor.","Disaster Management"
"On the other hand, the disruption to air traffic in a major eruption of the scale of Tambora or even Krakatau would be unprecedented. Only in the era of jet engines has this become a serious problem, when only eruptions of VEI 5 (Pinatubo)—or more often 2, 3 or 4—have had to be dealt with.","Disaster Management"
"Although the density of flights in Europe ensured that Iceland’s Eyjafjallajökull (2010) caused the greatest cancellation of flights so far, it is our region that has caused the greatest damage to planes.  ","Disaster Management"
"Only when two 747s lost engine power flying into the ash thrown out by Mount Galunggung in West Java in 1982—one of them narrowly averting a crash after losing all four engines—was the aviation world spurred into serious action.","Disaster Management"
"In the 1990s a system of reporting activity and advising pilots was gradually put in place. The world has been divided into nine regions, each monitored by a Volcanic Ash Advisory Centre (VAAC). Our region, including the dangerous volcanic arc from Sumatra to the Solomons, [is monitored by the VAAC Darwin](http://www.bom.gov.au/aviation/knowledge-centre/volcanic-ash/).  ","Disaster Management"
"Insurance companies have ensured that airlines heeded their advice. In the last decade, as travellers to Bali have been painfully aware, warnings from VAAC Darwin have caused flights between Australia and Indonesia to be grounded with unprecedented frequency on account of the following moderate Indonesian eruptions:","Disaster Management"
"- Sangeang Api (Sumbawa), May 2014 - Kelut (East Java), November 2014. Two engines were damaged beyond repair in one Jetstar flight which did not hear the warning, though the flight was completed.","Disaster Management"
"- Raung (East Java), July–August 2015 (twice)","Disaster Management"
"- Rinjani (Lombok), November 2015 to August 2016, (three times).","Disaster Management"
"Nobody knows what the effect of a repetition of a Tambora-scale eruption would be on today’s jet-dependent world. One hopes that some fraction of the large defence budgets of Australia and Singapore are being devoted to modelling and preparing for the appropriate response to a major disaster far more likely (indeed certain, in a longer time frame) than a repetition of the past military threats that have fed outdated military insecurities. Cooperation between military and emergency services in these two rich countries and under-resourced Indonesia, Papua New Guinea, and East Timor must begin before the disaster occurs, to establish trust, communication lines, and strategies. This kind of military and strategic engagement between neighbours has no down side in threatening others. It should be the minimum we ask of our governments.","Disaster Management"

"The move by Start Network and CDAC Network is the first of its kind by humanitarian non-governmental organisations (NGOs), as the labs will facilitate locally-created innovations that are driven by client needs, making the labs more locally driven than many other investments into innovation in the sector. The £10 million programme, funded by UK Aid, will end in March 2019.","Disaster Management"
"The four countries were selected because they are particularly prone to natural and man-made disasters ranging from floods, typhoons, drought, earthquakes and armed conflict. These disasters cost lives and cause wide displacement and economic loss every year.","Disaster Management"
"Innovations produced by the labs could range from developing better building materials and that are more resistant to flooding or earthquakes or easier to transport when reconstruction is needed, to new communications systems for communities to use in a crisis.

"Director of the [Department of Emergency Management](http://www.dem.gov.bb/) (DEM), Kerry Hinds, explained that the Road to Tsunami Recognition campaign was the brainchild of members of the Technical Standing Committee on Coastal Hazards (TSCCH), following a committee meeting last year.","Disaster Management"
"“It was important that we sought to show or demonstrate to the world that Barbados wanted to be tsunami ready,” she added. The TSCCH committee set out to do just that, designating Holetown as its pilot.","Disaster Management"
"Ms. Hinds explained that Holetown is a coastal community, susceptible to coastal and inland flooding. She added that it had benefitted from community-level programming and pilot projects in the past, which included a tabletop exercise.","Disaster Management"
"The DEM Director noted that when they were approached to take part in the Barbados-based scenario, members of the Holetown community were willing to see how they could improve on their readiness.","Disaster Management"
"The campaign was officially launched last November with the [unveiling of a tsunami sign at the Folkestone Park and Marine Reserve](http://gisbarbados.gov.bb/blog/tsunami-recognition-status-for-holetown/) in Holetown. That sign will add to the requirements the community is now required to fulfil to achieve the designation.","Disaster Management"
"Ms. Hinds explained that the Holetown community was required to complete 10 areas in its preparedness efforts before the UNESCO Recognition Board could issue the certificate. The requirements for the designation are broken down into the three phases of the disaster management cycle – mitigation, preparedness and response.","Disaster Management"
"Under mitigation, she explained, the Holetown community was required to designate and map tsunami hazard zones. In addition, there needed to be a public display of tsunami information and response that identified the location of danger zones; when persons were leaving or entering a hazard zone; and the evacuation routes and assembly areas.","Disaster Management"
"Under preparedness, the pilot community needed to produce easily understood tsunami evacuation maps which outlined what persons needed to do; where they were in the community; and where they needed to go if a tsunami occurred.","Disaster Management"
"“There must be development and distribution of public awareness materials. Like any other preparedness phase, we have to ensure that we conduct an annual community exercise and we have to hold at least three outreach or educational initiatives annually,” Ms. Hinds pointed out.","Disaster Management"
"Meanwhile, under the response phase, the DEM Director said the there was a need to incorporate the tsunami hazard into community or national emergency plans.","Disaster Management"
"“We also have to commit to supporting an Emergency Operations Centre during an event. In Barbados, once we have an event the Emergency Operations Centre is established. We have to have a reliable means of communicating on a 24-hour basis the official threats from the warning focal point to the Emergency Operations Centre and from the Emergency Operations Centre to the public. There must be a way for us to warn the public on a 24-hour basis if it happens morning, noon or night. Those are the areas we need to address,” she indicated.","Disaster Management"
"However, Ms. Hinds admitted that there were three outstanding areas which needed to be addressed. Those, she outlined, were producing the easily understood evacuation maps; designating the hazard zones, evacuation routes and assembly areas; and designating and mapping the tsunami hazard zones.","Disaster Management"
"“We have been very successful in terms of the public outreach and ensuring that we address the tsunami hazard within our emergency operation plans. We have a National Emergency Operations Centre and we have a way of communicating with and warning the public.","Disaster Management"
"“You will find that the areas that we now have to really focus on is the science of it in terms of producing those maps that people can act on,” she said.","Disaster Management"
"She added that once the UNESCO Recognition Board was satisfied that Holetown met all its requirements, the recognition would be awarded through an official ceremony and with a plaque indicating that it was now a Tsunami Ready Community.","Disaster Management"
"“Holetown’s recognition will stay in place for three to five years. If after that you want to maintain the Tsunami Ready status, you have to go through the process again. It would be a case of doing the annual drills and maintaining the public awareness programme,” the DEM Director revealed.","Disaster Management"
"Once successful, Holetown will have the distinction of being among a number of countries and territories that have the UNESCO internationally approved Tsunami Ready Certificate of Recognition.","Disaster Management"
"Ms. Hinds said the recognition would say to the world that Holetown was active in promoting readiness for any kind of emergency and that the community is more prepared to save lives.","Disaster Management"
"“It says to the world that we have identified the community readiness resource needs…we have taken the time to say what it is that Holetown requires to improve its readiness and it also says that the community in Holetown readily engages its contact with the emergency services, so that they know what they need to do or who they need to contact.”","Disaster Management"

"Climate-driven extreme weather events are on the rise and often impacting vulnerable communities least equipped to deal with them. On International Day for Disaster Reduction, Regional Technical Specialist for UNDP, Mariana Simões reflects on the links between climate change, disasters, and development – and how investment in adaptation can help save lives and protect development gains. ","Disaster Management"
"With recent extreme weather events, we all bear witness to the likely impacts of climate change.  The strength of the hurricanes in the United States and the Caribbean, and the wet season-related flooding and mudslides in Bangladesh and Sierra Leone, are all in line with what we should expect with climate change.  ","Disaster Management"
"While extreme events are not new, their increased frequency and intensity have become the new normal, with corresponding impacts on lives, livelihoods and assets.  Worldwide losses from natural disasters are estimated at US$100 billion annually.  In 2016, losses were estimated at US$175 billion, 70% of which were attributed to meteorological, hydrological and climatological events.  2017 losses may surpass these figures, with estimates for Hurricane Harvey alone exceeding US$100 billion. ","Disaster Management"
"The formidable challenge of humanitarian relief and recovery following a disaster puts incredible strain on limited public resources.  In developing countries especially, it can force shifts in national development priorities, placing at risk fragile gains in health and economic development. ","Disaster Management"
"Targeted investments to reduce disaster risk can help protect countries from these impacts.  It is estimated that for every dollar invested in disaster risk reduction, US$2-$10 are avoided or reduced in disaster response and recovery costs.  ","Disaster Management"
"Climate risk informed planning, and investments towards improving climate resilience, could therefore result in long term savings from reduced loss and damage, and allow progress towards achievement of sustainable development goals.  ","Disaster Management"
"Adaptation refers to the measures needed to reduce vulnerability and/or increase capacity to manage the impacts of climate change (such as changing rainfall patterns, increased tropical storms, or more extreme temperatures). In practice, it involves different things in different countries.  ","Disaster Management"
"For instance, in mountainous Bhutan, greater intensity of the monsoon season has resulted in increased incidence of flash floods and landslides - destroying crops in low lying areas, damaging roads and disrupting access to services and markets.  Adaptation in Bhutan must therefore consider the steep terrain, with measures focused on slope stabilization and sustainable land management.  ","Disaster Management"
"In Viet Nam, its long coastline leaves it vulnerable to sea level rise and typhoons.  Coastal adaptation measures, such as mangrove rehabilitation and climate resilient housing, are therefore needed to protect coastal communities.  ","Disaster Management"
"While such measures cannot prevent extreme events, they can significantly reduce impact – saving lives and reducing economic loss and damage.  ","Disaster Management"
"The [Paris Agreement](http://www.undp.org/content/undp/en/home/presscenter/events/2016/april/Paris-climate-agreement-signing-ceremony.html) established the global goal on adaptation of enhancing adaptive capacity, strengthening resilience and reducing vulnerability to climate change, with a view to contributing to sustainable development.  ","Disaster Management"
"This critical link to sustainable development was further stressed recently by [Ministers from Least Developed Countries](https://ldcclimate.wordpress.com/2017/10/09/ministers-from-least-developed-countries-commit-to-ambitious-climate-action-and-call-for-global-community-to-step-up-support-at-un-climate-change-negotiations/) (LDCs), when they reiterated that “adaptation and loss and damage are crucial components of the global response to climate change, especially for LDCs which are particularly vulnerable to the adverse impacts of climate change.”","Disaster Management"
"While the will exists for countries to invest in adaptation, the impact of extreme events will continue to force decisions, ones that pit urgent needs against sustainable development planning.  ","Disaster Management"
"Through their Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs), countries detailed not only their emissions reduction targets, but also adaptation priorities to address current and future climate change.  In line with the Paris Agreement, vulnerable countries will need support to meet their targets and address their adaptation priorities – enabling them to move out of the cycle of responding to disasters and towards greater preparedness and sustainable development.    ","Disaster Management"
"The impacts of climate change are being seen and felt around the world.  For UNDP, supporting vulnerable nations to adapt and reduce disaster risk are key elements for enabling sustainable development.","Disaster Management"

"- Hard-fought development gains can be reversed by harsh climates and adverse weather.  ","Disaster Management"
"- Africa’s first-ever ministerial level Meteorology Hydromet Forum formally recognizes the role hydromet services play in development.  ","Disaster Management"
"- Investing in hydromet, or weather, water, and climate services, reduces the risk an economy faces from natural disasters and climate change.","Disaster Management"
"“Hydromet” or weather, water, and climate services affect the decisions people, communities, and governments make every day. A family at their farm, a shopkeeper in a store, or a government worker on a dam, all need accurate, timely information to make well-informed day-to-day decisions. This can come from something as simple a river gauge, which warns of rising water levels, to more advanced weather forecasting systems alerting an entire country of the approach of a cyclone.","Disaster Management"
"Disasters related to weather, water, and climate badly affect communities and cause billions of US dollars in economic losses every year. Globally, hard-fought development gains are placed at risk. Add the consequences of climate change, and such losses could increase.","Disaster Management"
"Africa has the world’s least developed weather, water, and climate observation network, with less than 300 of its weather stations meeting the World Meteorological Organization’s (WMO’s) observation standards. As much as 54 per cent of its surface weather stations, and 71 per cent of its upper-air weather stations, do not report accurate data. Budgets to maintain key infrastructure run short each year, and the cost of modernization investment needed amounts to more than US$1.5 billion.","Disaster Management"
"These costs can be eased, however, or effectively offset. Countries can save US$13 billion in asset losses annually by investing in hydromet, as well as saving US$22 billion in losses to well-being, and US$30 billion through a resulting increase in productivity.","Disaster Management"
"**Investing in hydromet creates savings**","Disaster Management"
"Overall, every US dollar (or its equivalent) invested in hydromet services has the potential to generate at least three dollars’ worth of benefits. Plus, being able to understand, predict, and warn citizens about natural hazards and disasters drives the ability of governments to reduce economic risks and save lives.","Disaster Management"
"Advancements in hydromet services also generate economic growth.","Disaster Management"
"Put simply, farmers who know when it will rain can avoid having fertilizer washed away, or move livestock to high ground before flooding. Fishermen with reliable information can avoid risking their lives at sea and improve efficiency on their boats. Transporters can prevent the unsafe movement of people and goods during heavy storms by using early warning systems.","Disaster Management"
"The World Bank and the [Global Facility for Disaster Reduction and Recovery (GFDRR)](https://www.gfdrr.org/) worked with governments and other partners to form the Africa Hydromet Program, which supports the national and regional modernization of hydromet services. This initiative is raising US$600 million in funding to modernize old forecast technologies and build new ones. The program will make weather data more accessible and give officials and other decision makers the opportunity to better provide better weather prediction services for their citizens.","Disaster Management"
"In the Democratic Republic of the Congo, for example, better hydromet services are helping communities deal with everything from volcanic eruptions to floods.","Disaster Management"
"The World Bank and GFDRR are helping improve the quality of these services, with weather forecasts disseminated through the media, agricultural information services, extreme weather warnings, and forecasting specific to aviation.","Disaster Management"
"Indonesia's bustling capital is sinking faster than any other city in the world - but a mega project to protect it from encroaching seas is contested","Disaster Management"
"BANGKOK, Sept 14 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - Indonesia's bustling capital, Jakarta, is sinking faster than any other city in the world. But an ambitious plan to build a giant wall to keep out the encroaching sea has come under fire from fishermen who fear for their catches and homes, and water experts who say it doesn't do enough to tackle land subsidence.","Disaster Management"
"The city's northern areas have sunk 4 metres (13 ft) in the past 40 years, Japanese experts say, while some 'hot spots' are said to be dropping as much as 20 centimetres a year.","Disaster Management"
"The 10 million residents of the low-lying coastal city, built on a swampy plain, are exposed to tidal and seasonal flooding. In 2013, parts were submerged under nearly 2 metres of water after a heavy monsoon storm.","Disaster Management"
"Jakarta's vulnerability to floods - already exacerbated by population growth, urbanisation and changing land use - rises with every centimetre the ground falls.","Disaster Management"
"Experts and residents agree that over-extraction of groundwater for drinking and commercial use is largely responsible for the land subsidence.","Disaster Management"
"What they don't agree on is how to tackle it. An iconic infrastructure project that is supposed to ease Jakarta's flooding woes is mired in uncertainty.","Disaster Management"
"The Dutch, regarded as the foremost authorities on the concept of ""living with water"", are lending their expertise via the flood prevention plan involving a giant sea wall that will close off Jakarta Bay, which could cost up to $40 billion.","Disaster Management"
"Critics, however, say the National Capital Integrated Coastal Development (NCICD) programme does not address land subsidence - the underlying reason for flooding.","Disaster Management"
"At the same time, ""the government is throwing away access to the sea"" for tens of thousands of people in the bay who rely on fishing and fish-processing, said Ahmad Marthin Hadiwinata of the Indonesia Traditional Fisherfolk Union.","Disaster Management"
"He worries that local residents will be evicted from their homes to make way for the new infrastructure.","Disaster Management"
"Unveiled in 2014 - and better known as the ""Great Garuda"" or ""Giant Sea Wall"" - the project involves raising and strengthening the existing onshore embankment of Jakarta Bay, as well as constructing a 15-mile outer sea wall and developing real estate on artificial islands reclaimed from the ocean.","Disaster Management"
"Seen from the air, the mega construction project was initially shaped like a garuda, the bird-god of Hindu mythology that is Indonesia's national symbol.","Disaster Management"
"But the design was changed in response to opposition and a government request to incorporate another project led by private developers to build 17 artificial islands, said Victor Coenen, Indonesia representative for Witteveen+Bos, a Dutch engineering consultancy leading the NCICD consortium.","Disaster Management"
"Its partners, which also include South Korea, are now awaiting the government's decision on the final plan, he added.","Disaster Management"
"A June document outlining an updated NCICD master plan, seen by the Thomson Reuters Foundation, confirmed the new design and emphasised the importance of stopping land subsidence, as well as addressing water and sanitation issues.","Disaster Management"
"The Ministry of National Development Planning did not respond to requests for comment.","Disaster Management"
"The NCICD is one of many water projects the Dutch have embarked on in their former colony. In May, Indonesia gave the go ahead to Dutch companies to build the world's largest tidal power plant in eastern Indonesia.","Disaster Management"
"Three Dutch non-profit groups - Both ENDS, the Centre for Research on Multinational Corporations (SOMO) and the Transnational Institute - said in an April report that the NCICD threatened the livelihoods of tens of thousands of people and had failed to follow design guidelines that would apply in the Netherlands, calling it a ""pseudo-solution"".","Disaster Management"
"Hadiwinata from the Fisherfolk Union said local communities also object to a lack of consultation and impact assessments.","Disaster Management"
"At least 25,000 fishermen have been hit by work already done for the project and other land reclamation initiatives along Jakarta Bay, which have caused sedimentation, he added.","Disaster Management"
"They have to go further to find fish, whose numbers are now very low, he told the Thomson Reuters Foundation.","Disaster Management"
"Many, including Hadiwinata, are hoping Anies Baswedan, who won a hard-fought election for the post of Jakarta governor in April, will stop or modify the project when he takes office in October. Work was suspended for several months in 2016 amid regulatory and environmental concerns.","Disaster Management"
"During his campaign, Baswedan was vocal about his opposition to the NCICD but has said nothing since. He was not available to comment for this article.","Disaster Management"
"Coenen said stopping land subsidence is important but could take 15 to 20 years, meaning Jakarta should work on flood prevention at the same time. The future of the crowded city's flood protection lies offshore because it has no space for flood basins, he added.","Disaster Management"
"""It's only a question of how far offshore you go, how big you want to build, and how long you want it to last, because the smaller the scheme, the shorter the lifetime will be,"" he said.","Disaster Management"
"The project's first phase of strengthening the existing embankment along Jakarta's shoreline, which began in 2014, is about a third complete, Coenen said.","Disaster Management"
"Critics of the NCICD are hoping a three-year project to study and stop land subsidence, agreed in July between Indonesia and Japan's international development agency JICA, could help.","Disaster Management"
"It involves developing better monitoring systems to measure where subsidence is worst and groundwater extraction heaviest, raising awareness of the dangers, and undertaking mitigation measures such as regulating groundwater usage.","Disaster Management"
"It may be one to two years before there is reliable, consolidated data on land subsidence, but the findings will feed into the NCICD, JICA said.","Disaster Management"
"""Tokyo started regulating groundwater usage in the 1960s,"" said Jun Hayakawa, JICA's expert on water resource management. ""By the early 1970s, the groundwater extraction and land subsidence stopped.""","Disaster Management"
"If most of Jakarta's groundwater usage can be prohibited, the city may soon see results, he said.","Disaster Management"
"But this depends on how quickly the local and national governments can adopt regulations and provide alternative water sources, he added. That could be a major stumbling block.","Disaster Management"
"Indonesian water expert Nila Ardhianie said around 65 percent of Jakarta's residents are forced to use groundwater because the piped water system only covers about a third of the population. But she puts a larger share of the blame for land subsidence on commercial use by hotels, malls and businesses.","Disaster Management"
"Nearly every large government building also draws on deep groundwater wells, even though many have piped water, because groundwater is free for public buildings in Jakarta, according to Dutch think tank Deltares.","Disaster Management"
"Under the current system, operated by a city-owned water company and two private firms, universal access to piped water would be achieved only by 2022, too late to stop groundwater extraction in time to brake further land subsidence, the report from the Dutch non-profits said.","Disaster Management"
"Tokyo also had to build sea walls but they were raised gradually, said JICA's Hayakawa, suggesting Jakarta could do the same. ""We need sea walls to protect the lives and assets of people in Jakarta,"" he said.","Disaster Management"

"Saturday night Panama. Sunday morning Bangkok. Middle of the night in France. What do they have to do with a hurricane forming in the Caribbean? It means using every available UNICEF channel to get life-saving ‘be prepared’ messages through to those who may be affected, and doing it with no time lost.","Disaster Management"
"U-Report is a platform that UNICEF and partners use to bring about social change. Usually, we use it to ask youth and adolescents their opinions which we share with partners, but when a natural disaster is on the horizon, we can activate it to send short, sharp, simple messages to those living in the path of the storm to help keep them and their families safe.","Disaster Management"
"On Saturday night, Panama time, the alert comes from UNICEF Latin America and Caribbean regional office (LACRO) that a large hurricane is brewing. Some quick internal conversations via WhatsApp between the UNICEF Regional Advisor and U-Report LACRO Coordinator in Panama and it’s agreed that we should use U-Report to provide vital information. We need help from the Global Innovation Centre. A quick email or two later and the Bangkok office gets things going and gives the green light to promote with U-Report Global via Facebook in the countries in the path of Hurricane Irma – from St Kitts to Antigua, Haiti to Barbados, we want people to know basic life-saving information. And in this part of the world, that means having everything available in English, Spanish and French.","Disaster Management"
"A few hours later, the U-Report Global Campaign Manager wakes up at 6am and starts to work on the alerts and gets them posted before Panama is awake. She then takes the messages that have been prepared by the Emergency Team at UNICEF LACRO and makes them ‘U-Report friendly’ before the U-Report Global Coordinator in Chile checks the Spanish and a coordinator in France translates into French.","Disaster Management"
"It’s a global effort and it means that within 24 hours we’ve sent ‘how to stay safe’ messages to 2,500 people: 48 hours later, that number stood at 8,500.","Disaster Management"
"Last night Panama time, between 9pm and midnight, a new U-Reporter was accessing information about Irma every 10 seconds. Irma is now a category 5 hurricane. That’s the highest storm category possible and could mean potential devastation to lives, building, and livelihoods. Through our Facebook alerts, UNICEF’s team is reaching more people in the crucial hours before the hurricane hits – each hour over a hundred more people choose to receive these messages about how to protect themselves.  It means that we’ll then be able to keep in touch with these U-Reporters and identify their needs if and when heavy rain, mudslides, tidal waves and exceptionally strong winds hit. Most importantly, it means we can do our work to help keep more children and adolescents safe.","Disaster Management"
"We sometimes forget the power of the global community, but a global team allows us to respond quickly. U-Report Global aims to bring about social change and champions the very idea of a global community. As Hurricane Irma gathers force across the Atlantic, we hope it is kind to those in its path, and we hope that U-Reporters are able to use the information sent to keep themselves and their loved ones safe.","Disaster Management"

"While Madagascar experiences outbreaks of the plague, also known as the Black Death, in rural regions nearly every year, the country is experiencing an unusually alarming outbreak affecting major urban centers, including the nation’s capital and its major port city of Toamasina. Direct Relief sent a shipment this week full of protective gear, IV fluids and other items requested by health professionals working to treat the disease and prevent its spread.","Health"
"Between Aug. 1 and Oct. 30, 2017, 1,801 suspected cases were reported across the country, including places where plague is not usually seen. Of the confirmed and suspected cases, at least 127 have resulted in death, with numbers continuing to rise.","Health"
"The plague is an infectious disease caused by the bacteria Yersinia pestis and presents in humans in three forms: bubonic (the most common form; infects the lymphatic system and is usually spread when an infected rodent or flea bites a person), septicemic (when the bacteria enters the bloodstream), and pneumonic (when the bacteria spreads to the lungs).","Health"
"While bubonic plague is the most common form, the current outbreak has been mostly pneumonic cases. This is particularly alarming since the pneumonic form is the most lethal of the disease and spreads easily from person to person.","Health"
"Pneumonic plague’s incubation period is 1 to 3 days, and if untreated, can be rapidly fatal. Antibiotics and supportive therapy, including IV fluids, are effective if a patient is diagnosed and treated quickly. Antibiotics can also be effective in preventing spread of plague if taken by those who have been in contact with someone diagnosed or suspected to have the plague. Personal protective equipment is also crucial for healthcare workers treating patients with confirmed or suspected cases.","Health"
"Direct Relief is working directly with the Ministry of Public Health and the United Nations Population Fund Madagascar office to support plague centers and maternity centers in the regions of Analamanga and Atsinanana.

"Aid experts at the Department for International Development (DFID) have teamed up with the Met Office, NASA and US scientists to use for the first time a world-leading approach to accurately predict where and when cholera will spread.","Health"
"US scientists, working with NASA satellite data, have developed a model to predict where cholera is most at risk of spreading with an impressive 92 per cent accuracy in Yemen. UK aid is turning this from theory to reality, using these predictions and Met Office forecasting to give aid workers on the ground in Yemen the information they need to respond to cholera outbreaks quicker than ever before.","Health"
"DFID is helping to prevent the deadly disease spreading any further by working with UNICEF to target the delivery of vital support to areas predicted to be at greatest risk. This includes:","Health"
"- promoting good hygiene to prevent people falling ill in the first place;","Health"
"- stock-piling hygiene kits, jerry cans and chlorine to clean water in advance of an outbreak;","Health"
"- providing cholera treatment kits, rehydration salts, zinc supplements and intravenous fluid packs to treat people that have fallen ill; and","Health"
"- providing medical equipment for hospitals and clinics, such as cholera beds.","Health"
"DFID Chief Scientist Professor Charlotte Watts said:","Health"
"*""The conflict in Yemen is the worst humanitarian crisis in the world, with millions of people at risk of deadly but preventable diseases such as cholera.""*","Health"
"*""By connecting science and international expertise with the humanitarian response on the ground, we have for the very first time used sophisticated predictions of where the risk of cholera is highest to help aid workers save lives and prevent needless suffering for thousands of Yemenis before it’s too late.""*","Health"
"*""This breakthrough means that we no longer need to wait for cases of cholera to be detected before medical staff can start taking life-saving actions.""*","Health"
"Met Office Head of International Development Helen Bye said:","Health"
"*""Through our collaboration with DFID we are able to be part of this ground breaking approach to take early action against cholera, a waterborne disease, contracted through consuming contaminated water.""*","Health"
"Met Office meteorologists are able to translate our global modelling and scientific expertise to show where rain has fallen and where it will fall. We then provide weekly tailored guidance to DFID and humanitarian agencies including UNICEF to inform their life saving actions.","Health"
"Aid experts at DFID began using this data to work with UNICEF to prevent the spread of the disease in March 2018, ahead of the rainy season. Last year, Yemen suffered the worst cholera outbreak in living memory with more than 1 million suspected cases.","Health"
"There has not been a significant outbreak in cholera so far this year, with the number of suspected cholera cases significantly lower than last year. For example, during the last week of June this year there were 2,597 suspected cases and 3 deaths, down from 50,825 suspected cases and 179 deaths at the same time last year.","Health"
"Despite the predicted risk of cholera in Ibb – a governorate on the frontline of the conflict – being just as high this year as last year, there were only 672 suspected cases of cholera in July 2018 compared to 13,659 in July 2017.","Health"
"There are a number of other factors that could have contributed to a lower number of suspected cholera cases this year, including a later rainy season, greater immunity against cholera and a change in national guidance for the recording of suspected cholera cases. However, the new actions taken as a result of the predictions are helping to save lives and reduce suffering.","Health"
"This new approach is all the more important as the new guidance for recording suspected cholera cases in Yemen may make it more difficult to detect early outbreaks of cholera. Acting early and being able to target high-risk areas is critical.","Health"
"UNICEF Yemen Representative Meritxell Relaño said:","Health"
"*""The information on rainfall assessments supports the early warning on high risk areas for cholera outbreak. This enables UNICEF and partners to refine and focus our efforts on preparedness and timely response to cholera which has affected the lives of many children in Yemen.""*","Health"
"*""These rainfall predictions have helped ensure that crucial preventive and response measures are in place where they will be most needed, including agreements with implementing partners on the ground, prepositioning of essential supplies, disinfection of water sources and deployment of community volunteers to engage households and communities on preventive hygiene behaviours including, safe water storage. As a result of this support and our other preparedness and response work, we have been able to avoid a resurgence of cholera on the scale seen in 2017.""*","Health"
"The Met Office’s supercomputer in Exeter makes 14 thousand trillion calculations per second allowing it to take in 215 billion weather observations from across the world every day, which are used as a starting point for UK and global weather forecasts. In Yemen, high-resolution models are used to forecast out to six days, providing UNICEF accurate and critical intelligence as they identify areas most at risk.","Health"
"These forecasts have been used to improve a predictive model that was developed by scientists at two universities in the United States – West Virginia University and the University of Maryland.","Health"
"The forecast produced by the Met Office and the predictions produced by the US scientists are then shared with UNICEF and other aid so they can see which neighbourhoods, schools and hospitals will be at greatest risk, helping them to target their response to where support is needed most.","Health"
"This breakthrough of accurately predicting where and when the disease will spread has meant that aid workers can take action before an outbreak occurs.","Health"
"It is DFID’s ambition to combine the NASA data and Met Office forecasts in order to predict outbreaks eight weeks in advance – twice the current capability. This would help aid agencies plan major vaccinations campaigns ahead of outbreaks, protecting hundreds of thousands of individuals.","Health"
"Hassan was one of the first patients to arrive at Kutupalong camp’s only diarrhea clinic. Clutching on to his mother’s arm, the three-year-old slipped in and out of consciousness, sweat dripping from his little exhausted body.","Health"
"An ethnic Rohingya, Hassan recently came to Bangladesh, fleeing violence in neighboring Myanmar. More than half a million refugees arrived alongside him in recent weeks, making it the world’s fastest growing refugee crisis. Many witnessed their houses being burned to the ground and family members shot.","Health"
"Conditions in the camp are dire and a large-scale cholera outbreak is feared. Most of the new arrivals live in simple housing, made from bamboo sticks and plastic sheets that have been donated to them. They wade barefoot through thick mud; in areas where open defecation is practiced, this is a breeding ground for the water-borne cholera. ","Health"
"But with over 4,790 confirmed cases of diarrhea, there is so far only one management center for the disease, operated by Medical Teams International.","Health"
"Hassan had been sick for a few days, his parents said, initially afraid to seek medical help. Their son is now being treated at Medical Teams' in-patient unit.","Health"
"“The development of epidemics such as measles and cholera in refugee camps is our biggest fear. Acute diarrhea is a leading cause of death in children under five years old,” says Bruce Murray, a Medical Teams International doctor.","Health"
"“We are particularly concerned with the potential development of cholera. That’s why we scaled up quickly: we need the facilities for when it occurs, and we want to be in the frontlines of responding to this dangerous epidemic,” he added.","Health"
"Medical Teams International’s diarrhea management center is located in the heart of the Rohingya refugee camp, staffed with doctors and nurses ready to treat a potential outbreak.","Health"
"The facilities were a simple storehouse just a few days ago, but the international team has turned it into a fully operational in-patient center, with freshly painted floors, walls and ceiling fans.","Health"
"“We all worked together to set this up in just two days and we are already seeing patients. The turn-around has been quick, but it had to be. The facilities are important and life-saving,” explains Nurse Theresa Durkin. She arrived in Bangladesh as a volunteer only a few days ago and is already training local medical staff at the center. While some patients arrive for a quick treatment and dose of rehydration salts, others, like Hassan, are admitted to the in-patient unit, requiring longer-term specialized care.","Health"
"Outside the clinic, Kutupalong camp is hustling and bustling. Between the already existing houses, new arrivals have set up their tents, waiting to officially register in the camps. Most people have arrived solely with the clothes on their bodies. They often wait in line for hours to receive food distributions for their families.","Health"
"“I came here less than a month ago,” says Mehda, a young mother, holding her son Mohammed on her lap. “My house was burned and I lost my husband. I came here feeling desperate and sad. I know that living here will be very difficult, but I am glad I am receiving help, I don’t know how I would survive otherwise,” she added. Playing with her little son, she says that she was referred to the diarrhea management center by health workers in the community. ","Health"
"“In a sudden-onset response like this, we often work together with partners on the ground. In our case, we have partnered both with the UN refugee agency (UNHCR), as well as with a local non-profit who helps provide doctors and nurses on the ground,” explains Medical Team International’s Team Leader Dominic Bowen.","Health"
"“We also have community health workers in the camps, referring new patients to us,” he adds.","Health"

"**Antananarivo/Nairobi/Geneva, 10 October 2017**— The Malagasy Red Cross is training 1,000 volunteers and staff to serve on the frontline of its growing response to the outbreak of pneumonic plague.","Health"
"In Madagascar, cases of bubonic plague– spread between animals to humans through flea bites– occur nearly every year. The emergence of the more virulent pneumonic form is concerning and is testing existing preparedness efforts.","Health"
"“This time is different. The majority of infections and deaths are from pneumonic plague which is spreading from person-to-person and our volunteers have to learn a new set of skills to fight this old disease,” said Dr Fatoumata Nafo-Traoré, Regional Director for Africa for the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC).","Health"
"While the Malagasy Red Cross has responded to plague outbreaks in the past, most of these have involved the bubonic form where prevention and control efforts have focused on fumigation and environmental sanitation. Pneumonic plague requires additional infection control measures because it spreads through the air between people. Madagascar’s crowded urban areas, weak health systems and poor infrastructure are contributing to the rapid spread of the disease in major cities.","Health"
"“The Red Cross is one of the key actors on the ground working with the Government and international partners, and our volunteers are helping to address people’s fears by providing them with life-saving information and support,” said Andoniaina Ratsimamanga, Secretary General of Malagasy Red Cross. “We’ve mobilized more than 1,000 volunteers and are upgrading their skills on community surveillance, contact tracing and messaging to stop the spread of this terrible disease,” she added.","Health"
"Pneumonic plague–a virulent form of the bacteria yersinia pestis— is fatal if not treated early with antibiotics. The World Health Organization has recently shipped in 1.2 million doses of antibiotics to Madagascar–enough to treat 5,000 people and provide another 100,000 people with prophylaxes, if they have been exposed to the disease. Personal protective equipment and access to antibiotics will be critical for Red Cross volunteers to work in communities to ensure they are protected from the disease and preventing its spread to others.","Health"
"Over the weekend, IFRC released more than 360,000 Swiss francs from its Disaster Relief Emergency Fund (DREF) to support the expansion of Malagasy Red Cross community surveillance, contact tracing, water and sanitation, and vector control efforts.

"Brasilia, 23 February 2018 (PAHO/WHO) – Brazil recently received a shipment of 20 million syringes for use with fractional doses of the yellow fever vaccine. The syringes were provided by the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO) at the request of the country's Ministry of Health. The size of the syringes – 0.1 cm³, or the equivalent of 0.1 mL – allows health workers to deliver the exact fraction of the product needed, avoiding errors.","Health"
"In all, 2.43 million syringes have arrived at RIOgaleão – Tom Jobim International Airport, in Rio de Janeiro, and an additional 609,000 were expected to arrive in the following days. The total of 3,048,000 syringes come from a World Health Organization (WHO) reserve stock and were procured through the PAHO Revolving Fund, a mechanism that facilitates the purchase of high-quality vaccines, medicines and related supplies for countries and territories of the Americas. New shipments will be sent in the coming months.","Health"
"PAHO has been helping Brazil purchase the 0.1 mL syringes since last year, as the country prepared for a possible need to fractionate doses. The Ministry of Health decided to implement the fractionation strategy in January of this year, as the circulation of yellow fever virus was detected in densely populated areas that were not previously considered at risk. The goal is to extend the vaccine supply, protecting more people and reducing the possibility for disease spread.","Health"
"In this campaign, children aged 9 months to 2 years and people with medical conditions, among other groups, will receive the standard dose of the vaccine.","Health"
"To date, all of the human cases of yellow fever in Brazil have been linked to sylvatic (jungle) mosquitoes – Haemagogus e Sabethes. The last case of urban yellow fever in Brazil occurred in 1942.","Health"
"**Difference between standard and fractional doses**  ","Health"
"PAHO and WHO recommend the use of fractional doses of yellow fever vaccine in response to large-scale campaign needs. The use of fractional doses is not recommended as a longer-term strategy or to replace routine immunization practices (with the standard vaccine dose).","Health"
"The difference between the doses is in the volume injected: the standard dose is 0.5 mL and provides life-long protection; the fractional dose is 0.1 mL (1/5 of the standard dose) and provides immunity for at least 12 months, probably more.","Health"
"WHO bases its estimate of the immunity period on the experience with mass yellow fever vaccination in the Democratic Republic of Congo in 2016. Follow-up of people who received the fractional dose there showed that it is possible to provide immunity against the disease for at least 12 months. Studies are ongoing to determine the long-term protection provided by fractional doses. Research by the Oswaldo Cruz Foundation (Fiocruz) has shown that the fractional dose protects for eight years.","Health"
"Between July 1, 2017 and February 20, 2018, Brazil’s Ministry of Health reported 545 confirmed cases of yellow fever, which resulted in 164 deaths.","Health"
"During the same period a year earlier, 557 confirmed cases and 178 deaths were reported. Brazil’s yellow fever cases follow a seasonal pattern, occurring mainly during the summer months (usually with an increase in cases from December to May).","Health"
"The Ministry of Health of Brazil has emphasized the importance of vaccination in the states of Rio de Janeiro and São Paulo during the yellow fever immunization campaign. Preliminary data indicate that as of February 19, 5.1 million people had been vaccinated, 4.7 million of them with fractional doses and 422,600 with standard doses. The number vaccinated represents 25.2% of the target audience. The state of Bahia started its campaign in eight municipalities on February 19.","Health"
"Yellow fever is a viral hemorrhagic disease transmitted by infected mosquitoes. It can be prevented by an effective and safe vaccine. The most common symptoms are fever, muscle pain with prominent backache, headache, loss of appetite, and nausea or vomiting. In most cases, the symptoms disappear after three or four days.","Health"
"From 15% to 25% of patients enter a second, more toxic phase, in which the risk of death is higher and people may have yellowing of the skin and eyes, dark urine, and abdominal pain with vomiting and bleeding.","Health"
"*Dr Adele Daleke Lisi Aluma works to reach children who have never been vaccinated*","Health"
"When the sun rises in the health district of Bol, in Chad, Dr Adele’s day begins. Launching her canoe into the reed-filled waters of Lake Chad, and taking a look at the map, she readies herself for the long journey ahead. In four to six hours time she will arrive at a remote island, where there are children never before reached with vaccines.","Health"
"Dr Adele Daleke Lisi Aluma works in one of the most challenging areas of the world in which to vaccinate. In Bol, 45% of children live on difficult-to-access, remote islands, where geographical barriers, violence, insecurity, and poverty mean people usually do not receive health or other government services.","Health"
"Her job is to overcome these barriers, seeking out every last child for vaccination, whilst using her experience to ensure that the programme makes the best use of resources to reach the most children, every time.","Health"
"A first step for every campaign is to plan the route. Studying maps, and comparing information, Dr Adele and her team find the most efficient way to reach the multiple islands that must be visited by vaccinators.","Health"
"“The team often plans campaigns to take place at the same time as the weekly market, to vaccinate children when they are with their mothers buying and selling necessities,” she says.","Health"
"To increase acceptance of the vaccine, a few days before each campaign, Dr Adele and her colleagues telephone village elders and leaders, explaining why protection against polio and other vaccine-preventable diseases is so important.","Health"
"This helps to improve the programme’s reach. In the past, vaccinators sometimes travelled long distances over many days to islands where there are very few children. This meant wasted vaccine, as vaccinators were not able to keep the spare vaccines cold enough on the return journey to be used for other children. Today, better planning, as well as the purchase of solar refrigerators for vaccine storage, helps to solve this issue.","Health"
"“To maximise a vaccination session, we need to make sure our field operations are efficient and effective, minimizing missed opportunities” she says.","Health"
"Lake Chad is made up of waterways filled with reeds, trees, and wildlife: not a flat stretch of water. To get to the islands, Dr Adele uses a paddle canoe, deftly navigating the difficult terrain for hours at a time. The teams need to be careful – while steering straight and keeping the vaccines cold, they must also watch out for insect bites – and even hippos.","Health"
"Despite the challenges, she finds a huge sense of achievement in her work.","Health"
"“Reaching a difficult to access village gives me every time a sense of motivation to continue.”","Health"
"Upon reaching an island, Dr Adele begins vaccination. The majority of children in remote island villages have received less than three doses of oral polio vaccine, leaving them vulnerable to the virus. One by one, Dr Adele works to protect them.","Health"
"Dr Adele is driven in her work by her experience of a close family member with polio. Previously, she conducted immunization and epidemiological surveillance for polio in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and in Haiti, as part of a career that has taken her all over the world.","Health"
"With each campaign, Dr Adele vaccinates hundreds of children, but she also looks for signs of the virus.","Health"
"On a recent trip to the islands, she and her team discovered a child with acute flaccid paralysis, a potential signal of polio, who had not been reported to the polio surveillance network. While the child didn’t have polio, this underlines the crucial need for the programme to continue to access these difficult to reach places, vaccinate children, and encourage communities to report any suspected polio cases.","Health"
"Dr Adele is already helping to strengthen surveillance through training community members in each village to recognise the signs of a potential polio case.","Health"
"She is also planning her next journeys: “We plan to return soon to supervise and accompany vaccination teams in the island areas.”","Health"
"To reach the remotest communities in Lake Chad, this is what it takes.","Health"
"Women are critical in the fight against polio. From reaching every child with polio vaccines to ensuring their children receive the protection they deserve, women are at the heart of polio eradication efforts.","Health"
"In GPEI’s immunization activities, women frontline workers have increased the effectiveness of health service delivery. In many settings, only women can access households to vaccinate children. Female social mobilizers have improved attitudes toward polio vaccination and the perceptions of risks associated with the disease. Women on the frontline communicate directly with female caregivers and indirectly with other women in the community. The recruitment of local women, in particular, enables a larger capacity for trust.","Health"
"The Global Polio Eradication Initiative has continually developed and adapted local strategies to engage women in the critical decision to vaccinate their children – as caregivers of children and as the workers on the frontline of eradication.","Health"
"The progress the polio programme has witnessed in the past years would not have been possible without the hard work and commitment of courageous women who are dedicated to protecting children and making polio history.","Health"

"**In polio-endemic countries, frontline workers are utilizing every opportunity to ensure no child is left behind**","Health"
"Equipping every frontline worker to utilize every opportunity to vaccinate a child in the remaning polio-endemic countries has become a key strategic approach during and between polio campaigns. Vaccinators are trained in inter-personal communication approaches to ensure they skillfully engage caregivers at the doorstep, while increasingly, social mobilizers are being equipped with vaccine to identify and subsequently immunize those children missed during campaigns.","Health"
"In Nigeria, 21,000 UNICEF and CORE-supported Volunteer Community Mobilizers (VCMs) in the highest-risk northern states work between immunisation campaigns to register and refer pregnant women for antenatal care, conduct birth registration, promote routine immunization and provide life-saving messaging on handwashing with soap, exclusive breastfeeding, the prevention and treatment of diarrhoea, and screening of malnutrition.","Health"
"These services build trust with mothers in the community, allowing the mobilizers to attend the popular traditional naming ceremonies of newborn children. Over the past year, social mobilizers have vaccinated approximately 4 million children under 5 at these ceremonies and CMAM (community management of acute malnutrition) sites. An additional 350,000 children identified from non-compliant households have been tracked and vaccinated between campaigns by the VCM network since February 2015, and of the 1 million newborn children tracked by mobilizers in the past year, a further 930,000 received their first vaccination by these trusted mobilizers.","Health"
"In Afghanistan, nearly 7,000 full-time social mobilizers and supervisors are the face of the polio programme in urban areas and instrumental in building trust and demand for vaccination in their communities. Prior to campaigns, female mobilizers hold women’s courtyard sessions where women in the community gather to drink tea, and information is shared on the importance of vaccination against all vaccine-preventable diseases, exclusive breastfeeding and handwashing practices. During campaigns, these mobilizers are entrusted with tracking missed children due to absence or parental refusal and ensuring they are covered in the ensuing week. On average, 65% of children missed during campaigns due to absence and 30% of children missed due to refusal are vaccinated by mobilizers in their districts between campaigns.","Health"
"In Pakistan, more than 14,000 full-time Community-Based Vaccinators work throughout the month to reach every child in their area with vaccine, and generate demand for routine immunization. Known as ‘Sehat Muhafiz’, or ‘Protectors of Health’, these part-vaccinators, part-social mobilizers are drawn from the communities in which they work, and are supported by  community engagement and mass media strategies highlighting their critical role as health workers. These full-time Sehat Muhafiz are critical to the global eradication effort, targeting more than 2.8 million children under 5 in 417 Union Councils (UCs) in the highest-risk core reservoirs. The results have been strong: since the launch of the CBV model, the proportion of children missed in the highest-risk areas during national campaigns has fallen from 25% in 2014 to 5% in 2017 and 94% of areas are passed by independent monitoring. And the Data Support Centre database shows that CBV’s cover 90% of children missed during campaigns in the following week.","Health"
"A joint WHO-UNICEF training curriculum is being rolled out to ensure vaccinators have strong inter-personal communication skills, with more than 46,500 vaccinators in Afghanistan and 2,500 Area-in-Charges in Pakistan trained to date. Annual KAP studies conducted by Harvard Opinion Research Polling underline this investment in vaccinators. In Pakistan, 74% of caregivers stated that vaccinators are better in 2017 than they were last year, with 70% of respondents saying vaccinators were “very knowledgeable about children’s health” (up from 52% in 2016).","Health"
"These examples of social mobilization approaches are rooted in social data, with strategies driven by outcomes of community-based studies evaluating people’s perceptions about diseases and the benefits of vaccination.  Such social data also helps inform development of broader community microplans, all in efforts to ensure that indeed, no child is left behind.","Health"
"**Yemen: Government health staff are saving lives without salaries in the war-torn country**","Health"
"Thursday, September 28, 2017 — Yemen’s health service is experiencing widespread and critical problems, in part because most public sector health workers received their last regular salary a year ago, international medical organisation Médecins Sans Frontières/Doctors Without Borders (MSF) warned in a report released today. MSF is calling for financial support for government health staff without delay in order to avoid a further deterioration of life-saving medical services in Yemen. ","Health"
"In over two and half years of war, bombs, fighting, mass displacement and the spread of diseases have devastated Yemeni families. For the past year, most of the estimated 1.2 million Yemeni civil servants have received little to no salaries, including tens of thousands of public sector health workers across the country. MSF’s new report, Saving lives without salaries, is based on MSF’s experience in the country and includes the testimonies of MSF and Yemen Ministry of Public Health and Population (MoPHP) medical teams, patients and their families.","Health"
"“People don’t understand that we don’t always have drugs; we need to use our own money to buy the medication”, says a nurse at Al-Khamees health centre in Hodeida Governorate “People shout at us ‘Why are you here?!’” ","Health"
" “The commitment we see every day from government staff is humbling”, says Melissa McRae, MSF’s Medical Coordinator in Yemen. “Working for a year without pay, many are doing whatever possible to keep health services running, however minimally, while wondering how to keep their families fed, clothed and safe. Others have had to seek alternative employment or charge patients for medical care that should be available for free.”","Health"
"This is just part of the dire reality for health workers across the country; enduring the catastrophic effects of war, having seen loved ones die, working in health facilities that are often under attack.","Health"
"The massive ongoing cholera epidemic is a stark example of the consequences of the non-payment of salaries to medical staff. Unpaid salaries are driving the collapse of the already-weak public health system, the backbone of which are the doctors, nurses, midwives and other health personnel.","Health"
"MSF calls for an urgent response from the Yemeni authorities and the international community to ensure that health workers are paid immediately; receiving sufficient remuneration is a life-saving intervention. Not doing so will only accelerate the demise of the health system with fatal consequences. Preventable illnesses and deaths are increasing in Yemen, and this can be partially attributed to the non-payment of salaries for public medics.","Health"
"Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) is paying the salaries of 1,200 public health staff in the health facilities we manage and support across 10 of Yemen’s governorates, and last year we spent more than £50 million on our projects in the country. But our efforts are just a drop in the ocean.","Health"

"A delegation led by Abdelbagi Jibril, president of the Darfur Relief and Documentation Centre today handed an open letter to the Director-General of World Health Organisation (WHO), Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, urging him and his organisation to urgently intervene and address the cholera epidemic in Sudan. The letter was signed by 30 human rights and civil society advocates, organisations, and activists.","Health"
"“We wish to kindly draw your attention to the cholera epidemic currently ravaging many parts of the Republic of Sudan and causing the death of thousands of victims, especially in Sudan’s peripheral areas. Since the outbreak of the disease in August 2016, all of Sudan’s 18 states, including the national capital Khartoum and its twin cities Omdurman and Khartoum North (Bahri) are severely affected. The epicentre of the cholera pandemic is now reported in the war-ravaged Darfur region,” the letter states.","Health"
"“All indicators suggest the widespread nature of the disease and the need for urgent intervention by the World Health Organization. Evidence of the existence of this deadly disease in Sudan is that on 1st June 2017, Sudan’s Federal Minster of Health informed the National Assembly “Parliament” about the spread of the disease in many parts of the country and he provided precise figures of the number of confirmed cholera cases registered and the mortalities reported during the period of August 2016 – June 2017. Other independent sources, including the US Embassy in Khartoum and the United Nations International Children's Emergency Fund (UNICEF) confirmed, in two separate occasions, the spread of cholera in Sudan.","Health"
"“Although we believe that the figures indicated by the Government of Sudan (GoS) are conservative and do not reflect the reality on the ground, however, the case fatality rate deduced in June 2017 is over 1.8% of confirmed cholera cases, which is a mortality rate  above the threshold to declare cholera epidemic in a country. According to independent medical practitioners in Khartoum and elsewhere in Sudan, the numbers of confirmed cases of cholera are much higher and the mortality rate in some affected areas has reached over 10% of the declared cholera cases.""","Health"
"The letter calls on the WHO Director-General “to take leadership in addressing the cholera crisis in Sudan, especially in the Darfur region and save the lives of thousands of likely victims that are languishing in miserably camps for internally displaced persons. We particularly appeal to you to call upon the GoS to declare, in no ambiguous terms, the existence of a cholera pandemic in the country. We further call on the WHO to develop emergency plans for intervention to curb the ongoing cholera epidemic in Sudan, taking into consideration the special needs of regions of the country that witness concentration of vulnerable groups in densely populated makeshift settlements with extremely poor health service and sanitation such as Darfur, where environmental and health infrastructures are extremely poor.”","Health"

"**Abuja, 15 March 2018** - “When I received the confirmation of the first case of Lassa fever and request by  Nigeria Center for Disease Control to coordinate the contact tracing pillar of the outbreak, nothing prepared me for the tasks ahead other than my work in polio eradication, knowing that another responsibility beckons,”  said Mrs Faith Ireye, WHO State Coordinator in Edo state.","Health"
"“The confirmation on 05 January 2018 was reminiscent of the day that the first Ebola virus was reported in 2014 and the Country office in Abuja deployed some of us to assist with contact tracing in Lagos state.” ","Health"
"From 01 January to 04 March 2018, a total of 1,121 suspected cases of Lassa fever have been reported in across 18 states (Edo, Ondo, Bauchi, Nasarawa, Ebonyi, Anambra, Benue, Kogi, Imo, Plateau, Lagos, Taraba, Delta, Osun, Rivers, FCT, Gombe and Ekiti).  Of these, 353 are confirmed positive, 8 are probable, 723 are negative and 37 are awaiting laboratory results. Since the onset of the 2018 outbreak, there have been 110 deaths: 78 in positive-confirmed cases, 8 in probable cases and 24 in negative cases. Case Fatality Rate in confirmed and probable cases is 23.8%. ","Health"
"Deputy Governor of Edo State, His Excellency Philip Shaibu said, “WHO as we all know is one of the pillars that has helped lead surveillance in Edo state. Over the years they have been supporting surveillance extensively but in this particular outbreak, WHO was even the first to draw attention to the fact that we need to galvanize resources from all partners, from other parts of the country to ensure that things get done”.","Health"
"Edo state was one of the hardest hit by the outbreak that required a major response.","Health"
"“Nothing prepared me more for the task than my experiences in polio eradication activities, such as surveillance, supplemental and routine immunization,” said Ms Ireye, who has worked with the Polio Eradication Initiative for over 10 years. “My experiences in polio eradication activities allowed me to immediately swing into action. So, when the outbreak was confirmed, I realized the need to use my expertise to serve communities at risk in the state.”","Health"
"Faith Ireye is one of over 2500 WHO and 390,000 ad hoc personnel supporting polio eradication in Nigeria. On several instances, polio workers have provided frontline support for outbreak response. For example, polio workers were essential to containing the Ebola virus outbreak in 2014. For the Lassa fever response, 271 are involved in active case search, 235 in contact tracing and 320 in community sensitization activities in the 18 states active states.","Health"
"“The polio infrastructure was originally designed towards achieving the polio eradication goals,” said Dr Wondimagegnehu Alemu, WHO Country Representative to Nigeria. “Now polio infrastructure has expanded its support to broader disease surveillance strengthening, outbreak response and basic health care services including immunization.”","Health"
"With the imminent eradication of polio globally, plans are underway to determine how best to transition polio assets including health workers to retain their knowledge and skills.","Health"
"**Experienced network of personnel-gain for public health**  ","Health"
"Dr Fiona Braka, EPI Team Leader for WHO Nigeria, noted that besides helping with vaccinations, polio workers performed other functions critical to containing outbreaks such as Lassa fever, Yellow Fever, Cholera and Meningitis. ","Health"
"“Polio personnel are assisting with case identification, reporting, detailed investigation and contact tracing and community sensitization in the Lassa fever response,” Dr Braka said. ","Health"
"Other activities include data collation, analysis, reporting and archiving using mobile phones fashioned after the real-time tracking and reporting by polio vaccination teams. These activities fit into the polio essential functions of surveillance, outbreak response and containment that vaccine-preventable disease surveillance and laboratory networks rely on to save millions of lives threatened by diseases such as yellow fever and meningitis.","Health"
"“The polio teams on ground in the states were crucial for mounting the initial response to the Lassa fever outbreak and have continued to be WHO’s frontline technical support to the NCDC, States Ministry of Health and local government area teams”, Dr Emmanuel Musa, WHO Incident Manager for Lassa fever Management Team in Nigeria observed.","Health"
"Huge investments by donors and partners have gone beyond polio eradication to saving lives and impacting positively on people’s health. WHO and other partners are currently supporting the National transition plan development to ensure these investments are not wasted, but made available to support other National public health efforts and priorities. ","Health"
"“We must carefully consider how we transition many of the polio workers and the polio infrastructure to help with managing other health needs,” Dr Alemu said. “Future funding and partnerships will be a key part of this work.” ","Health"
"Support for immunization to the Government of Nigeria through WHO, is made possible by funding from the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, Department for International Development, European Union, Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance, Global Affairs Canada, Government of Germany, through KfW Bank, Japan International Cooperation Agency, Korea Foundation for International Healthcare,  Measles and Rubella Initiative through United Nations Foundation, Rotary International, United States Agency for International Development, United States Centre for Disease Control and Prevention and  World Bank.","Health"

"""You can have all the food and water in the world, but if nobody relieves you of your stress and helps you talk about your problems, it won't work,"" Kepa said.","Health"

"Despite focused efforts to stop the transmission of wild poliovirus in 2017, to date this year 17 cases have been reported globally; six from Pakistan and 11 in Afghanistan. During a series of meetings to review progress in the two endemic countries, which make up one epidemiological block, members of the Technical Advisory Group (TAG) on polio eradication concurred that while both Pakistan and Afghanistan continue to make progress, continued transmission threatens gains already made towards interruption.","Health"
"The TAG meetings, held in Islamabad and Kabul, recognized the efforts of both countries to coordinate activities closely, focusing on clearly identifying missed children, the reasons they have been missed, and putting in place operational plans to overcome these challenges. Efforts made to adjust national emergency action plans and build on the lessons learned from previous years and other countries have been commended by expert members of the TAG and hailed as key drivers behind the momentum.","Health"

"As a mass vaccination programme gets underway, IOM is working to provide vaccination support services and other services. These include community awareness raising; tracing of those who have come in contact with infected individuals to offer them preventative medical attention; and providing observation facilities for people recovering from the disease.","Health"
"On 6 December, the World Health Organization warned diphtheria is now spreading rapidly among the population in the over-crowded refugee camps of Cox’s Bazar.","Health"
"As of 11 December, around 449 probable cases had been identified with nine of these leading to deaths. However, it is believed the true numbers of those suffering from the disease may be considerably higher, as victims may confuse their symptoms with mumps, sore throats or other flu-like illnesses.","Health"
"IOM, which has been providing medical services to refugees and the local community in Cox’s Bazar since 2013, is now also set to expand its own in-patient capacity to 120 beds and offer support to help other organisations working on the ground to increase their in-patient facilities.","Health"
"As part of its broader health efforts, IOM is also taking on additional non-diphtheria-related cases, including measles cases, to allow specialists from other organizations to focus on the most severe diphtheria cases.","Health"

"Plague is an infectious disease caused by the bacteria _Yersinia pestis_, a zoonotic bacteria, usually found in small mammals and their fleas. It is transmitted between animals from their fleas. Humans can be contaminated by the bite of infected fleas, through direct contact with infected materials or by inhalation.","Health"
"There are three forms of plague infection, depending on the route of infection: bubonic, septicaemic and pneumonic (for more information, see the link below).","Health"
"- [WHO Plague Fact Sheet](http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs267/en/)","Health"
"Pneumonic plague-or lung-based plague is the most virulent form of plague and can trigger severe epidemics through person-to-person contact via droplets in the air. The incubation period can be as short as 24 hours. Typically, the pneumonic form is caused by spread to the lungs from an advanced bubonic plague. However, a person with secondary pneumonic plague may form aerosolized infective droplets and transmit plague via droplets to other humans. Untreated pneumonic plague is always fatal.","Health"
"Plague is an endemic disease in Madagascar; cases (predominantly bubonic plague) are reported nearly every year, during the epidemic season (between September and April). However, the ongoing pneumonic plague event has been reported in a non-endemic area and in densely populated cities for the first time.","Health"
"A pneumonic plague is a form of plague that is transmissible from person-to-person, with a potential to trigger severe epidemics if inadequately controlled. Detection of this outbreak occurred more than two weeks after the first case died during which cases travelled to different parts of the country, including the capital Antananarivo. Therefore, the overall risk at the national level is high. The overall regional risk is moderate due to frequent flights to neighbouring Indian Ocean islands. The global risk is low.","Health"
"Preventive measures include informing people when zoonotic plague is present in their environment and advising them to take precautions against flea bites and not to handle animal carcasses. The most rapid and effective method for controlling fleas is to apply an appropriate insecticide formulated as a dust or low-volume spray. People, especially health workers, should also avoid direct contact with infected tissues such as buboes, or close exposure to patients with pneumonic plague.","Health"
"Important prevention and control measures are primarily intended to reduce human transmission and avoid increase in epidemic. These include:","Health"
"- Advising the public to take all necessary precautions against flea bites and to not pick up or touch dead animals - Implementing measures to control rodents hosts of _Yersinia pestis_ (plague bacillus), especially rats - Avoiding direct contact with infected tissues such as buboes, or close exposure to patients with pneumonic plague - Early presentation to health care - go to the closest health center in the event of suspicious symptoms - Health workers and people who are in direct contact with pneumonic plague patients must wear personal protective equipment - Health workers should receive a chemoprophylaxis with antibiotics as long as they are exposed - Safe management and burial of deceased cases","Health"
"Rapid diagnosis and treatment is essential to reduce complications and fatality. Effective treatment methods enable plague patients to be cured, if diagnosed in time. These methods include the administration of antibiotics as Aminoglycosides, Fluoroquinolones, Sulfonamides and supportive therapy.","Health"
"Based on the available information to date, the risk of international spread of plague appears very low. WHO advises against any restriction on travel or trade on Madagascar based on the available information.","Health"
"International travellers should be informed about the current plague outbreak and that plague is endemic in Madagascar. Travellers should also be aware that Madagascar is endemic for malaria and should consider the antimalarial prophylaxis recommended by WHO when travelling to Madagascar (see link below).","Health"

"The risk of infection with_Yersinia pestis_ for international travellers to Madagascar is generally low. However, travellers in rural areas of plague-endemic regions may be at risk, particularly if camping or hunting or if contact with rodents . Travellers should avoid contact with dead animals, infected tissues or materials, and avoid close contact with patients with pneumonic plague. Travellers can protect against flea bites using repellent products for personal protection against mosquitoes, which may equally be protective against fleas and other blood-feeding insects. Formulations (lotions or sprays) based on the following active ingredients are recommended by the WHO Pesticides Evaluation Scheme (WHOPES) : DEET, IR3535, Icaridin (KBR3023) or Picaridin.

"In early January, John had one of the most terrifying experiences of his life. The mechanic from a rural community in Edo state in southern Nigeria came down with Lassa fever.","Health"
"“I was scared the illness would kill me,” says John, who prefers to go by a pseudonym.","Health"
"Initially, he went to a hospital near his home and was discharged a few days later. But he was still feeling unwell, so he consulted another doctor who suspected Lassa fever.","Health"
"John was taken to the Institute of Lassa Fever Control, a renowned treatment and research centre located in the Irrua Specialist Teaching Hospital, where he was correctly diagnosed and treated.","Health"
"“I was bleeding through my nose, mouth and ears,” says John.","Health"
"Lassa fever is an acute viral haemorrhagic fever, which is transmitted through direct contact with the blood, urine or other bodily secretions of an infected person or through exposure to the urine or faeces of infected rats.","Health"
"“The doctors and nurses were very good,” he adds. “I stopped bleeding.”","Health"
"The institute in Irrua is at the epicentre of Nigeria’s response to the country’s worst outbreak of Lassa fever on record. It is located in Edo state, where more than 40% of the 365 confirmed cases have occurred. The hospital has a special isolation unit for Lassa fever patients.","Health"
"“In the isolation ward, we usually take in a maximum of 24 patients but sometimes we get as many as 45 at a time,” says Professor Sylvanus Okogbenin, Chief Medical Director, Irrua Specialist Teaching Hospital. “We have had to put new wards in some of our buildings that are still under construction.”","Health"
"Isolation tents recently set up by the Alliance for International Medical Action (ALIMA) are being equipped to treat more patients.","Health"
"The hospital staff are working long hours due to the dramatic increase in their workload.","Health"
"“You arrive for morning duty but then you end up doing both morning and afternoon duty. We do not have enough manpower,” says Patience Osobase, Assistant Nursing Officer.","Health"
"While the Irrua institute has not had any Lassa fever infections among its staff, 16 healthcare workers in Nigeria have become infected and four have died. The hospital follows a protocol to prevent transmission from patients to staff, but the heavy workload has challenged these procedures.","Health"
"The Nigeria Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) is leading the response to the Lassa fever outbreak in collaboration with State Ministries of Health and local government health departments.","Health"
"“The Nigerian Centre for Disease Control has elevated the response to this outbreak to the very top level,” says Dr Chikwe Ihekweazu, NCDC National Coordinator and Chief Executive Officer. “We have activated our Emergency Operations Centre and we are doing everything we possibly can to respond to this outbreak.”","Health"
"NCDC, the World Health Organization and other partners have sent staff to support the institute at Irrua. Kevin Ousman – a WHO expert in Infection Prevention Control – is working with healthcare workers to ensure that the infection does not spread within the health facility.","Health"
"“We have identified what we think are some very quick fixes which are being introduced urgently,” said Mr Ousman. “We are also helping to train staff, ensuring sustainable solutions for the clinic.”","Health"
"WHO is supporting the response with a focus on strengthening coordination, surveillance, laboratory testing, clinical management, community engagement, and measures for infection, prevention and control.","Health"
"“The sooner treatment is started, the greater the chances of survival for patients,” says Dr Wondimagegnehu Alemu, WHO Representative to Nigeria. “So it is absolutely crucial that we get patients as early as possible to the treatment facilities.”","Health"

"Dr Jude Gedeon met with the media on Wednesday 11th October to give an update on the pneumonic plague situation in Seychelles. Speaking to several media houses, he addressed the case of pneumonic plague that was confirmed yesterday. He also stressed on current and additional measures being taken by the Ministry of Health to prevent this from spreading.","Health"
"“According to our guidelines once someone tests positive for the plague we do contact tracing,” Dr Gedeon said speaking of surveillance that will continuously be done. “This involves getting in touch with everyone who has come into direct contact with the infected person.”","Health"
"Everyone who had direct interaction with the infected person were immediately contacted. This includes his close family and friends. “There are 12 members of his close family who have been brought to the military academy in Perseverance to remain under active surveillance.” Additionally, other people have also been brought in for preventative treatment since the man attended a gathering upon his return to the country on Friday 6th October 2017. These people have been put on prophylactic treatment though none have having symptoms.","Health"
"Dr Gedeon expressed his unhappiness that advices were ignored. “Sadly in this case the person did not follow the recommendations of health officers and he attended a public gathering on Friday at Chili Bar.” He is also reminding everyone who have travelled to Madagascar and have been placed on passive treatment by the Public Health Authority to remain at home until notified otherwise.","Health"
"Several tests have been done on those who are admitted in isolation at the Seychelles Hospital. Since they do not have any cough and are not producing phlegm, the rapid test could not be performed. A blood sample has been taken and sent to L’Institut Pasteur in France for further tests.","Health"
"The Ministry of Health currently does not have the means of performing blood test for plague. Addressing the National Assembly earlier today, the Minister for Health has confirmed that this equipment should be available in the country within two weeks to be used along with the precautionary measures in place.","Health"
"**NEW MEASURES BEING IMPLEMENTED AGAINST PNEUMONIC PLAGUE:**  ","Health"
"- Everyone entering Seychelles from Madagascar will immediately be referred to the Isolation centre in Perseverance.  ","Health"
"- No foreigners coming to Seychelles from Madagascar will be granted entry. Only Seychelles citizens will be allowed to enter the country.  ","Health"
"- A Travel Advisory has been issued, in collaboration with Seychelles Tourism Board requesting all transiting points (Mauritius, Kenya, and Reunion) to redirect all passengers who are not a citizen of Seychelles.  ","Health"
"- Cargo ships will continue to be monitored as before. If anyone presents with symptoms within less than 7 days of leaving Madagascar, the ship will remain in isolation at sea. If anyone on board is sick, they will receive treatment.  ","Health"
"- Cruise ships are advised to remain at sea for at least 7 days before entering the port after visiting Madagascar. If it is less than 7 days (incubation period) all passengers and crew will remain under surveillance for the recommended time before entering the country. ","Health"
"- Dr Gedeon concluded by issuing further advices. Fisherman who continue to informally visit Madagascar are advised to cease this practice. If they have visited Madagascar they are also advised to come forward and be placed on treatment if necessary. Members of the public are advised not to panic as there is no outbreak within the country. They are additionally advised to remain updated with latest information that is correct.","Health"
"In an interview today, Tuesday 10th October 2017, Dr Jude Gedeon, Public Health Commissioner confirmed that a 34 year old man has been infected with pneumonic plague. The man who travelled to Madagascar, arrived in Seychelles on Friday 6th October 2017, at which point he was placed under passive surveillance.","Health"
"“He presented with symptoms yesterday. He was not feeling well and reported to a health centre. Because he was under surveillance, he was immediately put in isolation at the Seychelles Hospital,” Dr Gedeon said. Several tests were done, some of which had normal results. “We also conducted a rapid plague test which produced a weakly positive result,” Dr Gedeon added. Following this, the result was sent to L’institut Pasteur in France for cross-checking, at which point it was confirmed to be a positive plague result.","Health"
"The man has been immediately given antibiotic treatment and all person who came into direct contact with him has also been put under active surveillance. These include his partner who also presented with symptoms today but has not been confirmed to be infected and a child who resides with the two.","Health"
"Dr Gedeon has reassured that there is no reason to panic and that the Public Health Authority is continuing to enforce measures to prevent an outbreak within the country. “We continue to monitor passengers who enter the country from Madagascar. There are currently 42 people who are under passive surveillance,” he stated.","Health"
"Moreover, 15 people who have been identified to have come into contact with the man have also been put on antibiotic treatment to prevent infection.","Health"
"“Plague can easily be treated with antibiotics when detected early. And, our objective is to have early diagnosis, and identification of points of contact so we can administer treatment early,” Dr Gedeon further added with regards to strategies being implemented by the Ministry of Health.","Health"
"At the moment, Air Seychelles has cancelled all flights to and from Madagascar as a further preventative measure. All members of the basketball delegation was who put under active surveillance at a centre is Perseverance have also been discharged following no presentation of symptoms.","Health"
"**The discovery of the poliovirus in Nigeria last summer shocked eradication efforts. Here’s how Rotary is making sure it doesn’t happen again**  ","Health"
"For a 13-month-old boy whose family lives in northeastern Nigeria, escaping Boko Haram was only the beginning of a long, difficult journey.","Health"
"When his family finally arrived at the Muna Garage camp for internally displaced people (IDP), they had walked more than 130 miles in three days. They were starving, and the camp was only a temporary setup with inadequate facilities, housing more than 15,000 people. But the worst news was yet to come. Health officials in the camp determined the baby had polio.","Health"
"“It was heartbreaking,” says Tunji Funsho, chair of the Nigeria PolioPlus Committee and a member of the Rotary Club of Lekki Phase I. Funsho met the boy on a trip he took in August to three of the country’s IDP camps. “At least (the family was) able to escape Boko Haram. The child was able to walk but with a limp, and was quite malnourished.”","Health"
"If it weren’t for the polio surveillance system that the World Health Organization (WHO) has in place at every one of Nigeria’s IDP camps, Funsho says, the boy’s polio could have easily gone unnoticed. In fact, it was a shock to the entire polio eradication effort in the country that a case existed at all.  ","Health"
"The country hadn’t had a case since July 2014 and had been removed from the list of polio-endemic countries. But in August 2016, routine surveillance methods, which include sampling of sewage and wastewater to look for viruses circulating in the wild as well as monitoring and investigating all cases of paralysis in children, discovered two cases of polio in Borno state – one of them the 13-month-old. (Two more cases were subsequently reported.) Polio wasn’t gone from Nigeria after all. ","Health"
"“The new cases devastated us. Even one case is unacceptable. It’s very unfortunate we are in this position, but we are recalibrating our efforts to end this disease,” Nigeria’s health minister, Isaac Adewole, told Rotary leaders during a meeting at Rotary International World Headquarters at the time. “We consider this situation a national emergency.”","Health"
"The polio surveillance system, carried out mostly by WHO and the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), two of Rotary’s partners in the Global Polio Eradication Initiative, consists of several parts. First, doctors and other community health workers such as healers and traditional birth attendants monitor children for paralysis. “Most times cases are not discovered at a medical facility – they’re discovered at home by the volunteer community mobilizers and people who are paying regular visits,” Funsho explains. “They find a child that is limping or unable to use a limb they’ve used before. They’re trained and they know the questions to ask.” If they discover a paralyzed child, the health workers report the case to WHO, which sends a surveillance team to collect stool samples from the child and his or her siblings for testing.   ","Health"
"The second part of the surveillance process involves local authorities collecting samples from sewage systems or, in places that don’t have adequate sanitation facilities, rivers and bodies of water near large settlements. The samples are sent to a lab, one of 145 in the Global Polio Laboratory Network, which looks for the poliovirus. If it is found, the samples go on to a more sophisticated lab where scientists perform genetic sequencing to identify the strain and map where and when it has been seen before.","Health"
"The worldwide scale of these surveillance efforts is massive and costs roughly $100 million every year. For the most part, these activities take place only in countries that don’t have adequate health systems already established. In the U.S., for example, if a child showing signs of paralysis visits the doctor, the necessary tests for polio are already a part of the working health system. But in countries that don’t have such a robust system, WHO takes on that responsibility. That means investigating more than 100,000 cases of paralysis around the world every year to rule out polio.","Health"
"In Nigeria’s IDP camps, surveillance is more complicated. Before people enter, they are screened by security agencies (there have been several cases of suicide bombers trying to infiltrate the camps). Next, at the camp’s health facility, doctors evaluate the new arrivals’ overall health and screen them for polio. Volunteers then document what villages they have traveled from, using the information to track who is in the camp, where they are within the camp, and who their family members are.","Health"
"**The challenge of mobile populations**  ","Health"
"Before the new cases were detected, the surveillance teams working in IDP camps were vaccinating and searching for suspected polio cases as usual. ","Health"
"But in the official documents, when they were reporting their findings, the teams weren’t marking the displaced people as being located in their camps: They were being counted by their area of origination. However, surveillance teams and vaccinators weren’t actually traveling to some parts of the state where the displaced people had come from because the presence of the Boko Haram terrorist group made it difficult. ","Health"
"“This gave the impression there was good surveillance (in those areas), when in fact there were major blind spots,” says Mark Pallansch, director of the Division of Viral Diseases at the CDC. “We knew this was an area of concern, so we implemented additional measures to try to strengthen surveillance.” ","Health"
"The extra measures included scaling up environmental surveillance and sampling healthy individuals – including adults – for the presence of poliovirus as they exited inaccessible areas. Teams also searched IDP camps and host communities more frequently and reassigned the acute flaccid paralysis cases by place of onset. It was in part thanks to such strengthened activities that additional polio cases were found.","Health"
"But the surveillance situation remains volatile, Pallansch confirms. “This really underscores the dangers of any low-level residual polio transmission in the face of any subnational surveillance gaps,” he says. “We still don’t have an exact idea of virus transmission in some areas of Borno. Operationally, we have to therefore assume that it remains an infected area and our focus has to be on reaching the children with the vaccine, all the while plugging the surveillance holes.” ","Health"
"A major part of the problem is that in the area where the cases of polio were discovered in Borno, the health system is decimated, impeding the discovery and reporting of the poliovirus. In December, WHO health monitors reported that 35 percent of 743 health facilities in Borno were destroyed and 29 percent were damaged. Sixty percent of the remaining health sites have no access to safe water. ","Health"
"But it’s not just the breakdown of the health system that is causing the problem. Until recent military incursions by the Nigerian government, Boko Haram occupied more than half of Borno. And, unlike the Taliban, which controls areas of Afghanistan (one of only two other countries that have yet to eradicate polio), Boko Haram does not negotiate with vaccinators who want to enter areas they are in.   ","Health"
"Nigeria isn’t the only area of the world that has regions with limited access. The GPEI has begun an extensive analysis of surveillance in other countries to ensure that the Nigerian “blind spot” isn’t a problem elsewhere. “Boko Haram makes many parts of the area virtually inaccessible. Depending on where Boko Haram is, that can be inclusive of bordering countries,” Pallansch says. “It will take some time to gather information and analyze it properly. But at a first pass it’s not quite as worrying as some may think, except in those areas we already know are problems. In places like South Sudan and parts of the Horn of Africa, the border of Afghanistan and Pakistan, we’re intensifying our efforts.","Health"
"“In a sense, the situation in Borno is a good comparison to the global situation,” Pallansch says. “Ninety-nine percent of Nigeria is polio-free. But unless you eradicate the disease completely, the rest of the country will remain at risk. The same holds true globally: 99 percent of the world is polio-free. But all countries remain at risk until we finish the job everywhere.”","Health"
"Through genetic testing of stool samples taken from the new polio patients, the GPEI traced the poliovirus to a strain that emerged in Chad almost five years ago and circulated through Chad and parts of Nigeria. It had been eliminated from accessible areas, but it turns out that it never left parts of northern Nigeria.","Health"
"The discovery triggered an increase in vaccinations in other countries that have similarly inaccessible areas. In Nigeria alone, more than 850,000 children were vaccinated in the first five days after the cases were discovered, according to the country’s health minister. And Nigerian border countries coordinated efforts to increase protection of their own polio-free status. ","Health"
"The very nature of the GPEI’s system being at once a very large network of worldwide organizations and small groups such as Rotary clubs made up of local residents is what helped the teams respond so quickly to the new information, Pallansch says. “The system itself means there is surge capacity. No one place has to stand on its own. There are always other places within the system that can help,” he says. Because of that, the Polio Eradication Initiative continues on pace – revealing weak points where they may exist and fixing them – but still marching toward that day when polio is gone for good.","Health"
"After certification, the polio surveillance network is likely to continue providing services. It has already been used to help contain other deadly diseases such as Ebola and measles, and there are ongoing discussions about what the surveillance strategy will be after polio, according to a spokesperson at WHO. The biggest question is how that network can be maintained so that it can go on hunting for other diseases. ","Health"

"A major Oral Cholera Vaccine (OCV) campaign contributed to the effort – the first of its kind in Nigeria.","Health"
"With support from Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance, the International Coordinating Group (ICG) provided 1.8 million OCV doses to immunize 900,000 people in two rounds between September and December this year.","Health"
"Following an initial spike in cases, the number of new infections dropped significantly after the vaccination campaign concluded.","Health"
"“Containing cholera in the midst of an ongoing conflict is a major accomplishment,” said Dr Wondimagegnehu Alemu, WHO Representative in Nigeria. “No single measure would have worked on its own. This was a joint effort employing a range of tools by many partners under the leadership of the State Ministry of Health.”","Health"
"The outbreak began in August on the outskirts of Maiduguri, and quickly spread through several camps for internally displaced persons and host communities. By 19 December, 5,365 suspected cases had been reported, including 61 deaths.","Health"
"An early warning and surveillance system supported by WHO was critical to providing data on suspected cases in different locations. WHO pinpointed where the outbreak was expanding and contracting through a GIS “dot mapping” approach, which allowed WHO and partners to effectively target interventions.","Health"
"The response included providing safe chlorinated water, identifying and treating the sick in established cholera treatment centres, reaching out to communities with information on cholera prevention, and facilitating laboratory testing to confirm new cases.","Health"
"Partnerships with local media helped to ensure that people in affected and neighbouring communities were aware of the risk of cholera, how it is spread, how to prevent it, and the importance of seeking treatment when they experience the symptoms.","Health"
"Due to ongoing conflict, many people in north-eastern Nigeria have not had access to basic healthcare and routine immunizations for years, and health conditions in many camps for internally displaced persons are sub-standard.","Health"

With the support of WHO and other health actors moved to quick action to control outbreak, with that strong resolve to limit mortality and morbidity, this was achieved, and we can say that we have succeeded. A little over 5000 cases was recorded across 6 Local governments area in Borno state, Jere, MMC, Dikwa, Monguno, Mafa and Guzamala LGAs and with 61 deaths reported. ","Health"
"The cholera outbreak ongoing in other parts of the world was a wake-up call, that if we toy with it, it will toy with us. Given the weakened health system resulting from long years of insurgency and the high population density in Muna garage camp, made it paramount for immediate and coordinated response to avoid pit falls experienced by other nations with similar challenges. I must say that we have succeeded in controlling the outbreak. ","Health"
"This, certainly was as a result of the multi sectoral strategy adopted and the very strong partner leadership from WHO in coordinating with other implementing partners to support the state in closing identified gaps in surveillance, risk communication, water and sanitation among others. The preparedness of the health cluster to respond to cholera outbreak, effective partner coordination, swift activation of the Emergency Operations Center, efficient case management and surveillance were the strong points that helped us disrupt transmission and reduced mortality to about 1%, as this could have been worse given previous outbreak like that in 2010. Today, we are more than 2 weeks without any case reported and this signifies that we have come to the end of this outbreak. ","Health"
"Our collaborative effort proved very useful in this instance and has shown that working together we achieve faster and better. Building partnerships across all sectors is the only sure way to work now and in the future. ","Health"

Measures have been put in place to ensure effective sample collection and testing to enable laboratory confirmation. Risk communication activities have been heightened to advise the public on preventive measures. All 36 States and the FCT have been notified for preparedness.","Health"
"In light of the above, it is important to be reminded that monkeypox is a rare viral zoonotic disease with symptoms in humans similar to those seen in smallpox patients, but much less severe and with a low fatality rate. Transmission is via contact with infected animal, human, or contaminated materials. Animal-to-human transmission occurs through bite or scratch from animals and bush meat preparation. It can also be transmitted from one person to another. Human-to-human transmission occurs through respiratory droplets, contact with infected persons or contaminated materials. Control measures include isolation of suspected or confirmed cases, strict adherence to universal precautions, especially frequent handwashing with soap and water, and use of personal protective equipment.","Health"
"Signs and symptoms include fever, headache, body pain, malaise, lymphadenopathy (enlargement of glands), sore throat, the characteristic generalized vesicular rash. The rashes might last between two to four weeks. Monkeypox is self-limiting, which means patients tend to recover with time. However, supportive care and management of condition is required and mostly successful.","Health"

"- According to a WHO statement on 6 December, diphtheria is rapidly spreading in the refugee camps in Cox's Bazaar, with the epicentre of the outbreak being located in Kutupalong, Balukali and Jamtoli refugee camps. As of 8 December, over 110 people have contracted the disease, including six fatalities. The majority of people affected are between 5 and 15 years old. This airborne disease is highly contagious in congested environments. Immediate relocation of populations and additional sites and land are required to limit the spread of the outbreak.  ","Health"
"- WHO, together with the Ministry of Health and health partners, is rapidly scaling up prevention and treatment response, as currently only one agency has the capacity and available medicines to admit and treat patients. Routine immunization with all antigens has been instructed to start as of 9 December and will target children up to six years old. Lack of vaccines does not permit vaccination of older age groups for the moment. Dipthteria Antitoxin is being procured by WHO and is expected to arrive next week. Humanitarian agencies are assessing capacity to set up additional isolation tents. Additional human resources, isolation capacity, vaccines and supplies are urgently needed (PCV, TD and Pentavalent) to respond to the epidemic.  ","Health"
"- Meanwhile, UNHCR is scaling up its presence in the country, with the arrival of additional 80 staff members expected in the coming weeks. This follows a decision by the UN chiefs to put the refugee agency in the lead of the operations. This comes at a time when preparations are underway for a revision of the humanitarian response plan following the current one, coming to an end by February 2018.","Health"

"Diphtheria is considered endemic in Yemen. Given the volatile political and security situation, the rolling out of a mass vaccination is jeopardized by the lack of vaccines, a collapsed health system and limited humanitarian access.

"Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) intervened in the area at the end of October, in close collaboration with the Ministry of Health, and was in charge of leading the response for the case management.","Health"
"MSF teams set up two treatment centres, with a capacity of 10 beds each, in Kapchorwa district hospital and near the Kaproron Health Centre, to ensure adequate capacity and preparedness to manage a large-scale epidemic. These two centres will now be decommissioned.","Health"
"Healthcare staff in the district were trained at these centres by MSF staff experienced in haemorrhagic fevers outbreaks. The main fields of training included the safe management of suspect and confirmed cases, collection of laboratory samples and community surveillance. MSF also assisted the Ministry of Health and the World Health Organization with epidemiological surveillance, community health promotion and mapping activities during the epidemic. An MSF ambulance with isolation capacities was also deployed to the field.","Health"
"“This is the first time that Marburg fever has been diagnosed in these districts of Uganda, but strong national surveillance meant that the epidemic was noticed and confirmed early enough to allow for a rapid and effective collaborative response,” said Dr Natalie Roberts, head of MSF’s emergency operations. “Health promotion activities within the communities of the districts were also crucial to increase their understanding of this disease and raise acceptance for our intervention.”","Health"
"Viral haemorrhagic fevers, including Marburg and [Ebola](http://www.msf.org/en/diseases/ebola), are endemic in Uganda. The risk of outbreaks in the future is high, and it is therefore crucial that surveillance mechanisms and emergency preparedness are maintained.","Health"
"During this outbreak, MSF, the Ministry of Health and other partners also introduced and ran full-scale tests of new tools, which might improve the response to new outbreaks in the future.","Health"
"This included a mobile laboratory, built to allow for testing of high-risk samples, provided by the European Union. The deployment of such testing devices can significantly reduce turn-around time to receive confirmation of suspected cases via blood testing – the national laboratory is in Kampala, a 10-hour drive away.","Health"
"MSF also supported the use of antiviral drugs in the treatment and prophylaxis of Marburg, with the objective of reducing the mortality of the disease. The limited scope of the outbreak fortunately didn’t require the use of these antivirals, but regulatory and clinical discussions held with Ugandan Ministry of Health and other partners over their use should be useful to improve access to these medications in future outbreaks.","Health"
"“We are very keen to continue to collaborate closely with Ugandan Ministry of Health, the World Health Organization and other partners in Kampala, in order to improve our response to similar epidemics time after time,” added Dr Roberts. “This includes provision of quality patient care for confirmed and suspect cases, and support to health promotion within Ugandan communities to help with their understanding of this disease.”","Health"
"MSF was also active on the other side of the border in [Kenya](http://www.msf.org/en/where-we-work/kenya), conducting contact tracing, training health staff, and setting up a small treatment centre, which fortunately wasn’t used as no cases were declared in the country.","Health"

"As of 6 December, 110 clinically diagnosed cases of diphtheria, including six deaths have been reported, with most cases in the Balukhali makeshift settlement (BMS), located in the larger Kutupalong–Balukhali expansion site. Other cases have been detected in Jamtoli and Thangkhali settlements. Low vaccination coverage amongst the camp population increases their vulnerability to the disease, which is particularly deadly for children. Congestion in sites, unevenly distributed health facilities and poor WASH infrastructure facilitate the spread of the disease, particularly during winter. An emergency vaccination campaign targeting 250,000 children is to begin on December 10. Difficult terrain and lack of access to some areas in expansion sites are likely to hamper health services provision. Awareness raising will be important to ensure as many children as possible access immunisations.","Health"

The health facilities that do function, such as this hospital, are overwhelmed and cannot accommodate the increasing numbers of patients. To make matters worse, doctors have not been paid their salaries for many months. Dr. Ghalyan tells us that many doctors have left the hospital and either joined private hospitals or clinics in neighbouring cities, or left the country in search of a better living. Some of his acquaintances have lost their lives on the roads out of Yemen.","Health"

Even the equipment is not working and needs repair,” says Dr. Eman Alsheree, a gynaecologist at the hospital. “We only accept very serious complications where pregnant women or mothers are on the verge of death. I have seen women deliver children on the road, in a car or on the streets. There is no way I can provide them with treatment.”","Health"
"At the paediatric emergency room, children are sprawled across an un-sanitized open hall. Their attendants huddle by their sides.

"The patient was hospitalized on 7 August 2017 and died on 9 August 2017 at the Cayenne hospital from fulminant hepatitis. She may have visited a gold mining area near St. Elie (North center of the country). Investigations are currently ongoing in order to identify the patient's travel route.","Health"
"On 21 August 2017, the case was laboratory confirmed at the national reference center for arboviruses, Institut Pasteur Cayenne by RT-PCR. This is the first confirmed case diagnosed in this territory since 1998.","Health"
"In French Guiana, yellow fever is considered endemic. The overall immunization coverage is good as yellow fever vaccination is mandatory but immunization coverage might be low in specific populations like clandestine and illegal workers. Therefore, vaccination catch-up will be implemented in legal and illegal gold prospecting areas.","Health"
"French Guiana health authorities are implementing several public health measures:","Health"
"- An initial investigation was performed and further investigations are ongoing.","Health"
"- Vector control interventions are being implemented, especially in specific zones that the case visited. These include health facilities in Cayenne and Kourou, localities of the interior around Saint Elie, and in the Bas-Oyapock river area.","Health"
"- The feasibility of vaccination catch-up targeting workers in legal and illegal gold mining areas is considered.","Health"
"- Communication and messages on prevention measures for yellow fever are being disseminated in French Guiana, including to people who live in those areas.","Health"
"Yellow fever is an acute viral hemorrhagic disease that has the potential to spread rapidly and cause serious public health impacts in unimmunized populations. Vaccination is the most important means of preventing the infection.","Health"
"French Guiana is considered at risk for yellow fever transmission. A yellow fever vaccination certificate is required for travelers over one year of age. Vaccination coverage in French Guiana is optimal, however, the coverage in some populations such as clandestine workers, in mining areas could be sub-optimal and therefore at risk for yellow fever infections.","Health"
"While the exact place of infection remains under investigation, the most likely geographic area of infection appears to be around the border between French Guiana and Brazil along the Oyapock river.","Health"
"At this stage and according to the preliminary data, this case is not epidemiologically linked to the sylvatic yellow fever outbreaks reported from Brazil since January 2017. Sequencing and comparison with yellow fever virus strains from other countries is needed to understand the potential link between the different outbreaks and the evolution of yellow fever virus. Based on the information currently available regarding epidemiological situation and early public health actions, the potential for large epidemic and international spread exists but is limited and could be further reduced by vaccination.","Health"
"Advice to travelers planning to visit areas at risk for yellow fever transmission in South America includes:","Health"
"- Vaccination against yellow fever at least 10 days prior to the travel. A single dose of yellow fever vaccine is sufficient to confer sustained immunity and life-long protection against yellow fever disease. A booster dose of the vaccine is not needed.","Health"
"- Observation of measures to avoid mosquito bites.","Health"
"- Awareness of symptoms and signs of yellow fever in general population.","Health"
"- Promotion of health care seeking behavior while traveling and upon return from an area at risk for yellow fever transmission, especially to a country where the establishment of a local cycle of transmission is possible (i.e. where the competent vector is present).","Health"

"27 July 2017 | GENEVA - New WHO data from 28 countries - representing approximately 70% of the global hepatitis burden - indicate that efforts to eliminate hepatitis are gaining momentum. Published to coincide with World Hepatitis Day, the data reveal that nearly all 28 countries have established high-level national hepatitis elimination committees (with plans and targets in place) and more than half have allocated dedicated funding for hepatitis responses.","Health"
"On World Hepatitis Day, WHO is calling on countries to continue to translate their commitments into increased services to eliminate hepatitis. This week, WHO has also added a new generic treatment to its list of WHO-prequalified hepatitis C medicines to increase access to therapy, and is promoting prevention through injection safety: a key factor in reducing hepatitis B and C transmission.","Health"
"""It is encouraging to see countries turning commitment into action to tackle hepatitis."" said Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, WHO Director-General. ""Identifying interventions that have a high impact is a key step towards eliminating this devastating disease. Many countries have succeeded in scaling-up the hepatitis B vaccination. Now we need to push harder to increase access to diagnosis and treatment.""","Health"

In 2016, the World Health Assembly endorsed WHO’s first global health sectors strategy on viral hepatitis to help countries scale up their responses.","Health"
"The new WHO data show that more than 86% of countries reviewed have set national hepatitis elimination targets and more than 70% have begun to develop national hepatitis plans to enable access to effective prevention, diagnosis, treatment and care services. Furthermore, nearly half of the countries surveyed are aiming for elimination through providing universal access to hepatitis treatment. But WHO is concerned that progress needs to speed up.","Health"
"""The national response towards hepatitis elimination is gaining momentum. However, at best one in ten people who are living with hepatitis know they are infected and can access treatment. This is unacceptable,"" said Dr Gottfried Hirnschall, WHO's Director of the HIV Department and Global Hepatitis Programme.","Health"

"Viral hepatitis affected 325 million people worldwide in 2015, with 257 million people living with hepatitis B and 71 million people living with hepatitis C - the two main killers of the five types of hepatitis. Viral hepatitis caused 1.34 million deaths in 2015 – a figure close to the number of TB deaths and exceeding deaths linked to HIV.","Health"
"Hepatitis C can be completely cured with direct acting antivirals (DAAs) within 3 months. However, as of 2015, only 7% of the 71 million people with chronic hepatitis C had access to treatment.","Health"
"WHO is working to ensure that DAAs are affordable and accessible to those who need them. Prices have dropped dramatically in some countries (primarily in some high-burden, low-and lower middle income countries), facilitated by the introduction of generic versions of these medicines. The list of DAAs available to countries for treating hepatitis C is growing.","Health"
"WHO has just prequalified the first generic version of one of these drugs: sofosbuvir. The average price of the required three-month treatment course of this generic is between US$260 and US$280, a small fraction of the original cost of the medicine when it first went on the market in 2013. WHO prequalification guarantees a product’s quality, safety and efficacy and means it can now be procured by the United Nations and financing agencies such as UNITAID, which now includes medicines for people living with HIV who also have hepatitis C in the portfolio of conditions it covers.","Health"
"With high morbidity and mortality globally, there is great interest also in the development of new therapies for chronic hepatitis B virus infection. The most effective current hepatitis B treatment, tenofovir, (which is not curative and which in most cases needs to be taken for life), is available for as low as $48 per year in many low and middle income countries.

"*By Dr Poonam Khetrapal Singh, WHO Regional Director for South-East Asia*","Health"
"Viral Hepatitis is a major public health problem in the South-East Asia Region, and every person has a stake in controlling and eliminating it. Each year viral hepatitis infects millions of people across the Region, causing the death of around 410 000 persons – more than HIV and malaria combined. It is also a major cause of liver cancer and cirrhosis, contributing to premature morbidity and mortality, and undermining economic growth and the push to achieve health and wellbeing for all.","Health"
"Despite hepatitis’ outsized burden, it is estimated that just one in ten people infected with the disease know their status. Many others remain unaware that effective treatments exist, or that preventive measures are available, from basic hygiene to the hepatitis B vaccine. Regrettably, stigma and discrimination against those suffering the disease remain common.","Health"
"To overcome these barriers and eliminate hepatitis as a public health threat by 2030, as per regional and global targets, enhanced awareness and understanding of how to prevent, treat and manage the disease is vital.","Health"
"To achieve this, health authorities across the Region can increase the prominence of hepatitis-related information and advocacy. Clear, concise and accurate messaging regarding how hepatitis infection can be prevented, what its signs and symptoms are and how it can be treated is essential to empowering people to take action. Simple hygiene measures such as hand-washing and consumption of safe drinking water and hygienic food, for example, are powerful tools for preventing hepatitis A and E. Messaging targeted towards high-risk groups such as intravenous drug users and sex workers can meanwhile increase uptake of harm-reduction measures, while messaging aimed at political leaders and donors can highlight resource gaps and help obtain high-level buy-in.","Health"
"Health authorities can likewise expand the hepatitis-related knowledge and skills of health workers at all levels. From nurses and midwives to doctors and technicians, a clear understanding of viral hepatitis testing, treatment and care is needed. This can be done by enhancing medical and other health professional school curricula; creating and disseminating robust guidelines on all aspects of hepatitis testing, treatment and care; and providing specialized training on outbreak management. Clear directives on avoiding unnecessary injections and using ReUse Prevention syringes wherever injections are required can go a long way to decreasing the hepatitis burden. So too can universal uptake of the hepatitis B birth dose vaccine when followed by two-three doses in the first six months of life.","Health"
"Beyond policy-level interventions, each of us can contribute to raising awareness and helping eliminate the disease in our own way. We can share our experiences of hepatitis infection openly, challenging social taboos. We can express solidarity with persons affected by hepatitis, creating a culture of empathy and care. And we can also take a moment to learn more about the disease, sharing that knowledge with our friends, colleagues and loved ones. As Indian film star and WHO South-East Asia Goodwill Ambassador for Viral Hepatitis Mr Amitabh Bachchan demonstrates, hepatitis infection can happen to anyone at any time, and needn’t be accompanied by shame or guilt. It is a common and treatable disease; it is something we must all acknowledge and face up to.","Health"

Through our collective resolve we can enhance hepatitis-related awareness and action and eliminate the disease as a public health threat by 2030.","Health"

"A delegation led by Abdelbagi Jibril, president of the Darfur Relief and Documentation Centre today handed an open letter to the Director-General of World Health Organisation (WHO), Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, urging him and his organisation to urgently intervene and address the cholera epidemic in Sudan. The letter was signed by 30 human rights and civil society advocates, organisations, and activists.","Health"
"“We wish to kindly draw your attention to the cholera epidemic currently ravaging many parts of the Republic of Sudan and causing the death of thousands of victims, especially in Sudan’s peripheral areas. Since the outbreak of the disease in August 2016, all of Sudan’s 18 states, including the national capital Khartoum and its twin cities Omdurman and Khartoum North (Bahri) are severely affected. The epicentre of the cholera pandemic is now reported in the war-ravaged Darfur region,” the letter states.","Health"
"“All indicators suggest the widespread nature of the disease and the need for urgent intervention by the World Health Organization. Evidence of the existence of this deadly disease in Sudan is that on 1st June 2017, Sudan’s Federal Minster of Health informed the National Assembly “Parliament” about the spread of the disease in many parts of the country and he provided precise figures of the number of confirmed cholera cases registered and the mortalities reported during the period of August 2016 – June 2017. Other independent sources, including the US Embassy in Khartoum and the United Nations International Children's Emergency Fund (UNICEF) confirmed, in two separate occasions, the spread of cholera in Sudan.","Health"
"“Although we believe that the figures indicated by the Government of Sudan (GoS) are conservative and do not reflect the reality on the ground, however, the case fatality rate deduced in June 2017 is over 1.8% of confirmed cholera cases, which is a mortality rate  above the threshold to declare cholera epidemic in a country. According to independent medical practitioners in Khartoum and elsewhere in Sudan, the numbers of confirmed cases of cholera are much higher and the mortality rate in some affected areas has reached over 10% of the declared cholera cases.""","Health"
"The letter calls on the WHO Director-General “to take leadership in addressing the cholera crisis in Sudan, especially in the Darfur region and save the lives of thousands of likely victims that are languishing in miserably camps for internally displaced persons. We particularly appeal to you to call upon the GoS to declare, in no ambiguous terms, the existence of a cholera pandemic in the country. We further call on the WHO to develop emergency plans for intervention to curb the ongoing cholera epidemic in Sudan, taking into consideration the special needs of regions of the country that witness concentration of vulnerable groups in densely populated makeshift settlements with extremely poor health service and sanitation such as Darfur, where environmental and health infrastructures are extremely poor.”","Health"

"The patient was hospitalized on 7 August 2017 and died on 9 August 2017 at the Cayenne hospital from fulminant hepatitis. She may have visited a gold mining area near St. Elie (North center of the country). Investigations are currently ongoing in order to identify the patient's travel route.","Health"
"On 21 August 2017, the case was laboratory confirmed at the national reference center for arboviruses, Institut Pasteur Cayenne by RT-PCR. This is the first confirmed case diagnosed in this territory since 1998.","Health"
"In French Guiana, yellow fever is considered endemic. The overall immunization coverage is good as yellow fever vaccination is mandatory but immunization coverage might be low in specific populations like clandestine and illegal workers. Therefore, vaccination catch-up will be implemented in legal and illegal gold prospecting areas.","Health"
"French Guiana health authorities are implementing several public health measures:","Health"
"- An initial investigation was performed and further investigations are ongoing.","Health"
"- Vector control interventions are being implemented, especially in specific zones that the case visited. These include health facilities in Cayenne and Kourou, localities of the interior around Saint Elie, and in the Bas-Oyapock river area.","Health"
"- The feasibility of vaccination catch-up targeting workers in legal and illegal gold mining areas is considered.","Health"
"- Communication and messages on prevention measures for yellow fever are being disseminated in French Guiana, including to people who live in those areas.","Health"
"Yellow fever is an acute viral hemorrhagic disease that has the potential to spread rapidly and cause serious public health impacts in unimmunized populations. Vaccination is the most important means of preventing the infection.","Health"
"French Guiana is considered at risk for yellow fever transmission. A yellow fever vaccination certificate is required for travelers over one year of age. Vaccination coverage in French Guiana is optimal, however, the coverage in some populations such as clandestine workers, in mining areas could be sub-optimal and therefore at risk for yellow fever infections.","Health"
"While the exact place of infection remains under investigation, the most likely geographic area of infection appears to be around the border between French Guiana and Brazil along the Oyapock river.","Health"
"At this stage and according to the preliminary data, this case is not epidemiologically linked to the sylvatic yellow fever outbreaks reported from Brazil since January 2017. Sequencing and comparison with yellow fever virus strains from other countries is needed to understand the potential link between the different outbreaks and the evolution of yellow fever virus. Based on the information currently available regarding epidemiological situation and early public health actions, the potential for large epidemic and international spread exists but is limited and could be further reduced by vaccination.","Health"
"Advice to travelers planning to visit areas at risk for yellow fever transmission in South America includes:","Health"
"- Vaccination against yellow fever at least 10 days prior to the travel. A single dose of yellow fever vaccine is sufficient to confer sustained immunity and life-long protection against yellow fever disease. A booster dose of the vaccine is not needed.","Health"
"- Observation of measures to avoid mosquito bites.","Health"
"- Awareness of symptoms and signs of yellow fever in general population.","Health"
"- Promotion of health care seeking behavior while traveling and upon return from an area at risk for yellow fever transmission, especially to a country where the establishment of a local cycle of transmission is possible (i.e. where the competent vector is present).","Health"
"This case report illustrates the importance of maintaining awareness of the need for yellow fever vaccination, especially in areas with favorable ecosystem for yellow fever transmission.","Health"
"Yellow fever can easily be prevented through immunization provided that vaccination is administered at least 10 days before travel. A single dose of yellow fever vaccine is sufficient to confer sustained immunity and life-long protection against Yellow fever disease and a booster dose of the vaccine is not needed.","Health"
"WHO, therefore, urges Members States to strengthen the control of immunization status of travelers to all potentially endemic areas. Viraemic returning travelers may pose a risk for the establishment of local cycles of yellow fever transmission in areas where the competent vector is present. If there are medical grounds for not getting vaccinated, this must be certified by the appropriate authorities.","Health"

"*MANCHESTER, UK, Sep 21 2017 (IPS)* - Until this week, it had been 32 years since Mexico City suffered its last major earthquake. That was of 8.0 magnitude, which was approximately tenfold greater than Tuesday’s 7.1 magnitude. Over 5000 people died, and outside assistance was offered and received.","Health"
"Much has improved in the local, regional and international responses worldwide since then, particularly in strengthening the local capacity to respond. Mexico is no exception, and will have significant capacity to respond, fully supported by its neighbours and the Pan American Health Organisation’s (PAHO) disaster response.","Health"
"It’s possible that specific outside help, beyond the region may not be asked for, but if it is, the medical help will be through the Emergency Medical Teams system at WHO/PAHO, coordinated through its Emergency Medical Teams Coordination Cell.","Health"
"This will embed with the national ministry of health, and through its online ‘virtual on-site operations coordination centre’, will liaise with those registered international teams who have indicated their willingness to deploy and with government, choose who is best suited to the needs they have identified.","Health"
"This ensures that assistance is targeted on identified need, coordinated, and in the case of medical practitioners, that they are appropriately trained, qualified and can be officially authorised to practice in Mexico.","Health"
"The WHO registration and classification system ensures minimum/core standards are adhered to and that all teams are fully self-sufficient, in order not to add a further burden to the affected country.","Health"
"When thinking about what might be needed to assist, international teams must consider how long it will take to get there and become fully operational. This will shape the type of assistance they can give.","Health"
"For example, lifesaving surgery is done in the first few hours, so surgical assistance that takes days to arrive will be too late for this. However, it can be focused on the further management of complex injuries in the survivors if the local surgical capacity for this has been overwhelmed.","Health"
"Rehabilitation is often overlooked, but providing this type of support can free up beds by facilitating the early discharge of patents and provide much-needed support to them and their families in their homes.","Health"
"Any major disaster diverts health care personnel from their day-to-day tasks, but unrelated emergencies still continue to occur, and other non-disaster related health conditions still require care and treatment. Support to this less glamorous aspect of disaster response and maintaining essential emergency health care is still important to those affected.","Health"
"When thinking about international search and rescue, bear in mind that most victims of earthquakes are rescued by their fellow survivors and some by local and regional teams. Very few are rescued by international teams, as it simply takes them too long to get there.","Health"
"There were hundreds of international search and rescue personnel who responded to the earthquake in Nepal – and they saved 13 people. Everyone else was saved by the Nepalese.","Health"

When a psychological counseling is in session, volunteers from both places will be in attendance. The aim is to take good advantage of the Hong Kong professionals’ expertise, while pairing with Macau volunteers’ familiarity of local culture. Such perfect match can provide better service to the needy individuals, and greatly elevate the case success rate.","Health"

As of 9 June 2017, a total of 501 suspected cases including 104 deaths have been reported since the onset of the current Lassa fever outbreaks season in December 2016. Of the reported cases, 189 have been further classified, 175 laboratory-confirmed including 59 deaths and 14 probable cases (all dead).","Health"
"During the current Lassa fever outbreak, 17 Nigerian states (Anambra, Bauchi, Borno, Cross-River, Ebonyi, Edo, Enugu, Gombe, Kaduna, Kano, Kogi, Nasarawa, Ogun, Ondo, Plateau, Rivers, and Taraba) have reported at least one confirmed case. As of 9 June 2017, the outbreak is still active in 9 states (Anambra, Bauchi, Cross-River, Edo, Taraba, Nasarawa, Ondo, Plateau, and Kano).","Health"
"The ongoing outbreak response is focused at State and federal levels and involves coordination of weekly Lassa fever review meeting in conjunction with World Health Organization, United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the University of Texas Medical Branch (UTMB), and the African Field Epidemiology Network.","Health"
"The following response measures are being carried out:","Health"
"- Enhanced surveillance is ongoing in all affected states and Lassa fever cases are reported to the federal level and contact tracing is ongoing in affected states with an active outbreak through the state surveillance team.","Health"
"- The line listing of cases reported across all the states is ongoing and data are uploaded in the VHF database.","Health"
"- Lassa fever treatment centers have been established in the affected states to support case management. These centers are supplied with case management as well as infection prevention and control supplies.","Health"
"Lassa fever is an acute viral haemorrhagic fever illness. Lassa fever is transmitted to humans via contact with food or household items contaminated with rodent urine or faeces. Person-to-person infections and laboratory transmission can also occur. Lassa fever is endemic in Nigeria and other West African countries and causes outbreaks almost every year in different parts of the region, with yearly peaks observed between December and June.","Health"
"Overall, the current risk assessment for Lassa fever outbreak in Nigeria shows a declining trend of outbreaks. Considering this, ongoing response measures remains focused on preparedness and response in general and further risk of large scale outbreaks is not very high. However, a close follow up, active case searching, contact tracing, laboratory support and disease awareness (in the community and for health care workers) should remain ongoing. Although there is constant population movement between these Nigerian states, a large-scale disease transmission or outbreak spread has not been reported. However, there have been sporadic cases reported in Togo and Benin originating from Nigeria.","Health"
"Prevention of Lassa fever relies on promoting good “community hygiene” to discourage rodents from entering homes. In health-care settings, staff should always apply standard infection prevention and control precautions when caring for patients, regardless of their presumed diagnosis.","Health"
"On rare occasions, travellers from areas where Lassa fever is endemic export the disease to other countries. Although other tropical infections are much more common, the diagnosis of Lassa fever should be considered in febrile patients returning from West Africa, especially if they have had exposures in rural areas or hospitals in countries where Lassa fever is known to be endemic. Health care workers seeing a patient suspected to have Lassa fever should immediately contact local and national experts for advice and to arrange for laboratory testing.","Health"

"**PROVIDENCIALES, 15 September, 2017 -** Jay Deanne, a sombre 11 year-old, is trying to put a brave face on things, especially for his brother, Kennedy. He is now safe in the Enid Capron Primary School, one of two government shelters set up for those caught up in the terrifying hurricane, Irma, on the island of Providenciales, Turks and Caicos. But he felt far from safe while Irma raged, “I was very scared. There was lots of rain, thunder and lightning. The roof was shaking, outside things were flying and the roof blew off.” The next morning, after finding themselves flooded out, Jay left for the shelter with his mother, brother and father.  ","Health"
"The Deane’s are just one of many families pulling their lives together after Irma destroyed homes and infrastructure, leaving Providenciales with little electricity. It wasn’t as badly hit as several other sister islands like Grand Turk and South Caicos but things were bad enough. Jay’s father, and his cousin Hamilton, who saw the roof of his own house carried away by the wind as he huddled with 14 people, are among the number who leave the shelter by day to secure and rebuild their homes and get back to some semblance of normality. They return at nightfall to the relative safety that the shelter, which was itself damaged in the hurricane, can provide.  ","Health"
"And it is relative. Despite the best efforts of those running the compound, there are concerns that security is not as tight as it could be and it is difficult to control who comes and goes. To address this issue staff from the Department of Social Development and Gender Affairs, Tanzania Bain-Candio and Jean Williams, have visited the shelter to advise parents to be vigilant about their children’s safety and the need for supervision. They also engaged with the children on ways to keep themselves safe. Of the 53 people housed in the shelter, 14 are boys and nine are girls.  ","Health"
"For Elaine King, a UNICEF education specialist who visited the primary school as part of a 22-strong United Nations rapid assessment team, such child protection issues are paramount. “It’s really important to ensure that we have safe spaces for children and that we look after this aspect of their needs, not just water, food and shelter, as vital as they are. We also have to look to their future and try to address the trauma they have undoubtedly experienced.” She added, “Rebuilding is not just about homes and offices, which is already starting. We have to help rebuild the children’s lives too.” To this end, UNICEF is concentrating on opportunities for psycho-social support, promoting the emotional recovery of boys and girls affected by Irma through its Return to Happiness programme. This, in part, involves interventions such as play therapy where children can work through their experiences.  ","Health"
"According to King, “This kind of support is crucial. I’ve heard of some children displaying signs of trauma, with boys and girls putting on their uniforms and trying to go to school when everyone knows that the schools are closed and will be for some time. The children need long term help and that’s something UNICEF and its partners can provide. ”","Health"

"**Increasing reach in security compromised areas**","Health"
"In order to reach chronically missed children due to insecurity, the experts recommends the continued implementation of innovations, in collaboration with security agents, to reach more children in inaccessible areas of Borno State and the northeastern Nigeria as well as the Lake Chad Basin","Health"
"“Maintaining Nigerian security forces support is critical. It is estimated, using satellite imagery and profiling data from special interventions, that there are 162,616 eligible children in Borno state that are still currently unreached. In addition there are 178 inaccessible islands on the Lake Chad that have not been reached”, Dr Mkanda mentioned.","Health"
"Therefore, ERC recommends the Nigeria programme implementers to ensure the periodic review and validation of inaccessibility data as well as revision of innovations such as reaching every settlement (RES) and reaching inaccessible children (RIC) for best outcomes.","Health"
"Earlier, members of the ERC had provided inputs following technical presentations and observed extra ordinary efforts put in place to strengthen surveillance among difficult to access populations through innovative strategies. They were particularly impressed that recommendations from various reviews and expert committees are implemented and monitored.","Health"
"However, with Nigeria at risk of undetected polio transmission, the ERC stressed the importance of full   implementation of recent external surveillance review recommendations with focus on internally displaced persons and partially/inaccessible areas.","Health"
"Furthermore, ERC recommends, “Extra efforts are required to ensure AFP surveillance network reaches the nomadic population”.","Health"
"With fewer supplemental immunization activities planned from 2018, building population immunity will be dependent on strong routine immunization (RI) coverage. The conviction stems from recent survey data indicating less than 30% of eligible children have received all the recommended vaccinations.","Health"
"Realizing the magnitude of immunization work needed with human and financial resources required, the Executive Director of the National Primary Health Care Development Agency (NPHCDA) Dr Faisal Shuaib had declared RI as public health emergency. Therefore, ERC requested full implementation of the “Abuja Commitment” to urgently establish the political will needed to strengthen RI. The ERC also remained convinced that RI is the way to sustain and protect gains in population immunity against vaccine preventable disease, including polio.","Health"
"**Political commitment required to sustain resilience**","Health"
"Noting the waning political commitment, ERC recommended that the Presidential Task Force resume its meetings to review progress. Furthermore, ERC called for continuous advocacy to Nigeria Governors’ Forum to ensure states buy-in and release of local government area (LGA) level counterpart funding as well as increase active participation of LGA Chairmen in polio eradication activities, including attendance at evening review meetings.","Health"

"Washington, DC, June 23 2017 (PAHO/WHO) – When the first case of Zika virus disease was diagnosed in Brazil in May, 2015, “The Americas had the unfortunate distinction of being a testing ground for Zika Virus infections” and the disease then became “the new villain in this region, causing fear, economic losses, and most importantly, marking the lives of children and families affected by debilitating birth defects,” according to Pan American Health Organization Director Carissa F. Etienne.","Health"
"In a new perspective piece for the American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene, “Zika Virus Disease in the Americas: A Storm in the Making,” Etienne details PAHO’s quick response to Zika and warns, “Future epidemic waves of Zika Virus, which will put additional people at risk, remain likely.”","Health"
"Noting that “More than 700,000 cases of Zika virus disease have been officially reported to the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO) from 48 countries and territories of the Americas,” Etienne and co-authors Marcos A. Espinal and Thais dos Santos add that Zika tested public health capacities under the International Health Regulations, “highlighting the need for continued investment in health security” and the pressing need for innovative solutions to persistent problems.","Health"
"With some 500 million persons in Latin America and the Caribbean living in areas at risk for transmission of Zika, “The fight against Zika virus is not a 100-m race, but rather a marathon in which science and public health need to work hand in hand for the benefit of our peoples,” Etienne said.","Health"
"“Astute front-line health-care workers who first realized that they were detecting something unusual” in clusters of rash illness in Northeast Brazil, increases in neurological disorders like Guillain-Barre syndrome, and then increased numbers of cases of microcephaly are credited by Etienne with sounding the alert on the spread of this formerly obscure virus. ","Health"
"“The Zika virus experience proves once again that good clinical judgment and awareness of atypical events are crucial for the timely detection of emerging and reemerging diseases. It also points to the importance of investing in the health workforce as the first line of defense against infectious disease threats,” Etienne said.","Health"
"Circulation of Zika in the Americas was hard to diagnose because of similarities to dengue and yellow fever, and a backdrop of immunity to other flaviviruses, she noted. “The available defenses against the mosquito responsible for the transmission of these viruses are no longer sufficient to resist its aggressive spread. Therefore, the development of affordable new tools by the scientific community, including diagnostic tests and a vaccine against ZIKAV, as well as innovation in vector control, are urgent priorities. Our health systems will need to be prepared to ensure such new tools are introduced and that their benefits reach everyone, not merely a few,” Etienne added.","Health"
"Etienne outlined PAHO’s response, which coordinated more than 80 expert missions to 30 countries bringing in neurologists, neonatologists, obstetricians, epidemiologists, virologists, and specialists in research and health services organization.

"Abuja, 12 September 2017-As part of preparations towards a high quality exercise, a press briefing heralding the implementation of a national measles campaign in Nigeria was conducted on 11 September 2017 at the National Primary Healthcare Development Agency (NPHCDA) Headquarters in Abuja to ensure that every eligible child is reached to mitigate the disease burden.","Health"
"Nigeria along with other countries in the African region has embarked on a goal of measles elimination. However, in 2016 alone, Nigeria witnessed 183 measles outbreaks affecting 158 local government areas (LGAs).","Health"
"Addressing over 40 media practitioners,  the Executive Director (ED) of the NPHCDA, Dr Faisal Shuaib pledged that the upcoming measles vaccination campaign will be the best ever implemented by the country. To achieve set targets, he solicited the cooperation and collaboration of all stakeholders, particularly journalists and communities to ensure the success of the campaign towards the reduction of child deaths arising from measles and other vaccine preventable childhood diseases.","Health"
"Dr Shuaib confirmed that the Federal Government of Nigeria has already released counterpart funding to the tune of 3.2 billion Naira for the activities and called on State Governments to ensure timely release and disbursement of counterpart funds.","Health"
"The 2017-2018 vaccination campaign is planned to be conducted in phases by geographical zones from October 2017 to March 2018.","Health"
"Speaking on behalf of development partners at the briefing, World Health Organization Country Representative (WR) to Nigeria Dr Wondimagegnehu Alemu, commended journalists for always creating awareness on public health interventions but regretted that “continued measles outbreaks in Nigeria pose real challenges to the elimination efforts put in place by the country”.","Health"
"Available statistics according to the WR show that routine immunization coverage has not reached optimal levels at sub national level; and past campaigns did not achieve the desired 95% coverage.","Health"
"“As efforts build up to address routine immunization gaps, an equally intensive effort will be needed to ensure that the 2nd opportunity through the upcoming campaign reaches all eligible children. Several lessons have been learned from past campaigns and great capacity exists in-country to reach the target,” Dr Alemu said.","Health"
"He appreciated the Government of Nigeria for taking a leadership role in spearheading what promises to be a high quality exercise. The WR further stated that the additional financial support from GAVI and strong partnership with other stakeholders will pave way for a quality campaign.","Health"

"At the height of the Ebola epidemic, hundreds of students, taxi drivers and shopkeepers volunteered to bury their dead neighbours. A new study finds their actions stopped over 10,000 people from being infected with the disease.","Health"
"The study, which was published in the journal PLOS Neglected Tropical Diseases, used statistical modelling to measure the impact of Red Cross safe and dignified burial  teams during the Ebola outbreak. It found that the practice of safe and dignified burials potentially averted as many as 10,450 Ebola cases, decreasing the scale of the outbreak by over a third (36.5 per cent).","Health"
"Originating with a single case in Guinea, the West Africa Ebola epidemic was the largest in history. Over 28,600 people were infected and more than 11,300 died from the disease.","Health"
"Across Guinea, Sierra Leone and Liberia, Red Cross teams undertook the dangerous and complex task of burying people who had died from the disease. Dead bodies are particularly infectious and given the traditional burial practices of the communities - where people typically wash and touch the bodies to show their respect - the disease spread most rapidly at funerals.","Health"
"""To respond effectively, we had to change our entire approach to dealing with people who had died and their families,"" said Elhadj As Sy, Secretary General of the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC).","Health"
"""We talked to communities and did our best to understand their beliefs and priorities. Ultimately, we earned their trust, and this was critical to our success.""","Health"
"Over 47,000 safe burials were managed by Red Cross, accounting for over 50 per cent of all burials conducted during the outbreak. Teams were made up entirely of local volunteers: 1,500 in total, all of whom were trained by Red Cross.","Health"

"This evaluation was commissioned by MSF OCB with the agreement and support of OCBA, OCP and OCG. The initial intention had been to undertake a post evaluation of the collective MSF response to a large Meningitis C epidemic in Niger in 2015. However, a number of factors combined to make the execution of a real time evaluation of MSF meningitis activities in Niger in 2016 more realistic. 2015 saw the first large scale Meningitis C outbreak in Africa since 1979. It was caused by a unique strain of Neisseria Meningitidis C. There had been a worldwide shortage of C containing vaccines in 2015 and this was expected to continue into 2016. As a result in 2015 little reactive vaccination had been carried out in the Nigerien population making them potentially vulnerable to meningitis in 2016 given that they had little conferred immunity. ","Health"
"The findings are based on two field visits to Niger, analysis of relevant documents (reports, records, emails), interviews with a cross section of key people involved in the meningitis response in 2015 and 2016 and participant observation of ongoing events in real time. ","Health"
"**To use a more cohesive, collaborative approach was the ambition** for 2016 from the different OCs and this was informally agreed at the end of 2015. Basically the 8 regions of Niger were divided between the four operational centres and it was agreed there would be collaboration and communication related to epidemiological data and laboratory activities. ","Health"
"In addition, there would be one spokesperson who would represent MSF to all external actors – mainly the government and UN bodies. This position passed between three of the four HOM informally depending on their workload and other commitments. ","Health"
"Whilst geographical division made practical sense, there was a marked difference in the extent to which the different areas were affected and hence the different OCs were involved in meningitis activities. The comparatively low level of meningitis related activities this year hardly challenged the combined resources of the four MSF operational centres – for example OCP had minimal input as there were few cases in their regions of responsibility and the other sections all had manageable workloads. ","Health"
"**The most obvious failing in regards to collaboration was the non sharing of EPREP stock amounts** and vaccination cold chain capacity. Even treatment kits although similar, were not standardised across the sections. If regional backup support had been necessary (as was the case in 2015) standardisation is important to avoid confusion and a clear idea of available resources greatly assists emergency response. ","Health"
"**Practically, the concept of an MSF meningitis committee was a good one and worked well**, bringing all OCs together on a regular basis with Epicentre and allowing some level of discussion and collaboration. The absence of staff directly involved in managing the meningitis outbreak, e.g. emergency coordinators, potentially had the effect of reducing the immediacy and medical relevance of a number of the meetings. A recommendation to add case management to the agenda that initially mainly focused on epidemiology and vaccination strategies was implemented between the first and the second field visit. The meningitis committee could have perhaps started earlier and been used as a forum during the preparatory phase to better harmonise the MSF approaches to the meningitis outbreak.  ","Health"
"**Epicentre was playing a significant role in coordinating and incorporating the epidemiological and laboratory data** from MSF and public institutions and produced a weekly epidemiological bulletin.  ","Health"
"**The introduction of an inter-sectionally agreed line-list for medical data** is a very positive achievement for MSF, meaning that this much larger set of data coming from all sections can be analysed. Unfortunately for this outbreak the approved line list arrived after data had already started to be collected by the different sections meaning it had to be re-entered into the new line list creating more work.  ","Health"
"Laboratory results – that should help guide epidemic management – were still being shared very late with partners and MSF never formally received any results of the Pastorex tests undertaken in the regions even though MSF supplied the test kits. Ministry of Health systems set up to manage the transportation of CSF samples to the national reference laboratory were not respected by government employees and despite MSF offering to help this did not really improve.  ","Health"
"Vaccination activities were generally informed by epidemiological data and the time limit for effective vaccination was generally respected MSF supported campaigns. Lack of reliable population data given at central level and the Ministry of Health decision to limit the security stock and waste factor combined to 10% meant that in most cases population figures were underestimated and the vaccine stock was not enough. Due to redefined and more sensitive alert and epidemic thresholds proposed by WHO in 2014 (but officially available in 2015) epidemic “pockets” were identified at sub district level and vaccinated in an attempt to contain the number of cases.","Health"
"One year after the internal declaration of Grade 3 emergency on the northeastern Nigeria, the World Health Organization (WHO) is conducting a comprehensive review of its humanitarian response to address health needs of nearly six million people.

"**With five national campaigns since October 2016, Pakistan is well positioned to face the challenges ahead.**","Health"
"At the end of May 2017, more than 38 million children under the age of 5 were vaccinated against polio in Pakistan. During the campaign, over 250,000 trained polio workers went from house to house across the length and breadth of the country to vaccinate children against the crippling disease.","Health"
"This was one of five country-wide vaccination campaigns that took place during the 2016/2017 “low season” for poliovirus transmission. From October to May when temperatures are low in Pakistan, the virus remains less active, giving polio eradication experts the opportunity to get ahead of the virus.","Health"
"The end of the May polio campaign marked the start of the “high season” for poliovirus transmission. The ability of the poliovirus to infect children increases in high temperature and during heavy rainfall.  As a result, viral circulation is expected to be higher from June to September.","Health"
"With steady gains in the proportion of children vaccinated during the 2016/2017 low season, the May campaign achieved an overall goal of vaccinating 92% of the targeted children, according to independent post-campaign monitoring. The highest vaccination coverage rates were observed in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KP), Sindh and the Federally Administered Tribal Areas (FATA), some of the highest risk areas of the country, with rates increasing from 84% to 95% in KP and 77% to 93% in Sindh in the last nine months.","Health"
"However, more work is needed to bring vaccination rates up to 95%, the level identified as that needed to stamp out the virus for good. FATA remains the only region consistently over 95% in the last three campaigns, with Balochistan, Islamabad, Azad Jammu, Kashmir and Gilgit Baltistan not reaching the benchmark.","Health"
"With the high season underway, Pakistan is well-positioned to respond to these remaining gaps and challenges.  The current situation remains the best we have ever seen in the country, with the virus geographically limited. The number of cases has declined from 306 in 2014 to 53 in 2015, and to 20 in 2016. So far this year, the number of polio cases reported in Pakistan is three (compared to 13 the same time last year). However, this progress means that there is more to lose than ever before. The low season campaigns put the polio programme in a better position with which to fight the virus through the high season.","Health"
"While the number of new wild poliovirus cases remains record low, the environmental surveillance system indicates the virus remains a serious threat to children, with the proportion of samples being tested positive for poliovirus reaching 18 per cent as of May this year compared to 10 per cent as of May 2016. In particular, the environmental presence of the virus has increased in the Quetta block, Karachi and the twin cities of Islamabad-Rawalpindi. The programme is systematically addressing and responding to these challenges by focusing on reaching missed children and continuously improving campaign quality to remove every last hiding place of the virus.","Health"
"Government leadership is fully committed to the National Emergency Action Plan (NEAP), implemented via focused Emergency Operations Centers at National and Provincial levels, with emphasis on evidence-based decision making, a one-team approach between all of the partners of the GPEI and the government, highlighting the essential role of front-line workers at the center of the polio eradication effort, effective oversight of performance management and accountability, and coordination across the common Afghanistan-Pakistan epidemiological block. As eradication moves into the final stage, seamless cross-border coordination with Afghanistan, that has had four polio cases so far this year, becomes ever more critical to success in both countries.","Health"

"The World Health Organisation recently declared the end of the most recent [outbreak](http://www.who.int/emergencies/ebola-DRC-2017/en/) of Ebola in the [Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC)](http://www.who.int/csr/don/13-may-2017-ebola-drc/en/).","Health"
"By the time the outbreak was contained, eight people had been infected. Four survived. The first patient diagnosed in the outbreak (the index case) – a middle aged man who died on his way to hospital - got ill in April. It’s not clear how he became infected. But those who helped transport him to the hospital also became sick.","Health"
"This outbreak had the second lowest number of patients among all the eight Ebola outbreaks in DRC since 1976. The last one [in 2014](http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa1411099?query=featured_home&) lasted for three months and three quarters of the 66 people diagnosed with the disease died. The outbreak was traced back to a pregnant woman who had [slaughtered a monkey](http://time.com/3511101/ebola-congo-contained-spread/) brought home by her husband. The disease spread when she underwent a traditional surgical operation after becoming ill.","Health"
"The most recent outbreak was controlled more efficiently than the [2014 outbreak](http://www.who.int/csr/disease/ebola/one-year-report/virus-origin/en/) and sets an example for other countries. A combination of factors meant that it was possible to stop the disease from spreading. These included a prompt response, immediate diagnosis and treatment, a coordinated approach and the involvement of the community in identifying the case and minimising the spread of the outbreak.","Health"
"Following reports that an unknown illness had been identified in a remote community 1400 kilometres from the state capital, a multidisciplinary team of health workers and administrative officers was dispatched. They immediately swung into action conducting field investigations. They traced and collected blood samples from the suspected cases and sent the samples back to the capital for testing. The tests came back positive.","Health"
"The response team used an [alert system](http://www.who.int/csr/resources/publications/ebola/social-mobilization-guidance/en/) to notify members of the community of the cases. It also collected samples and tested them using a mobile laboratory.","Health"
"The team also succeeded in ensuring that [health workers](http://www.who.int/features/ebola/health-care-worker/en/) were not infected. In previous outbreaks in West Africa this had been a problem. Many health workers who came to help contracted the disease and [transmitted](http://www.who.int/hrh/documents/21may2015_web_final.pdf) it to patients and community members.","Health"
"Studies show that bats are the [reservoir](https://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v438/n7068/full/438575a.html) of the Ebola virus. Wild animals get infected when they come in contact with infected faeces or body fluids from the bats.","Health"
"The virus is transmitted to people when they come in direct contact with fluids or when they eat meat from infected bush meat. An infected person then spreads the disease to other people. An outbreak ends when the human to human transmission is interrupted.","Health"
"The [incubation period](http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs103/en/) of the virus ranges from 2 to 21 days which means that an infected person can take up to 21 days to develop [symptoms](https://www.cdc.gov/vhf/ebola/symptoms/index.html).","Health"
"An outbreak of Ebola is declared over when 42 days have passed since the last confirmed case tests negative for the virus. So, the count of the 42 days starts when the last confirmed case is declared free of the virus.","Health"
"During these 42 days an elaborate surveillance system is put in place. This includes an alert system that can be activated if a new suspect is identified, as well as testing capability. The surveillance system remains in place for several weeks after the last confirmed case has been declared negative. This is to make that any cases can be identified. An eye is also kept open for possible infections from the wild.","Health"
"The DRC experience underscores the fact that there are a number of areas that need special attention in an Ebola outbreak.","Health"
"First, governments should have efficient nationwide surveillance systems to monitor priority health conditions, beginning at the community level. This early warning system can detect deviations from the norm, including suspected Ebola cases.","Health"
"The surveillance systems should be linked to laboratory diagnostics for rapid confirmation of cases. This is especially possible today with the advent of field ready technologies reducing the turnaround time for diagnosis.","Health"
"Secondly, an outbreak response team with regional operation centres should be established and tested before an outbreak begin. It requires coordination among the different stakeholders to enable a rapid response. They should also be in touch with international agencies in case of cross-border emergencies.","Health"
"Thirdly, public health education plays a pivotal role because the quick spread of the disease is often fuelled by [community practice](https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm6426a2.htm) like burial rites and acceptance of disease survivors. This means that appropriate [communication](http://www.who.int/csr/disease/ebola/messages/en/) on the risks of the disease, infection, treatment and management should be delivered to the public in a culturally appropriate way.","Health"
"And finally, a resourceful public health system is necessary for a timely response. Governments should improve primary health care facilities by hiring and training more health workers and having efficient infrastructure, logistics, health information, governance and drug supply systems.","Health"
"In all, we need to remain vigilant because we’re dealing with “when” rather than “if” the next large outbreak happens.","Health"

"While in Maiduguri, the epicenter of the crisis in northeast Nigeria, Malala visited schoolchildren in a camp for displaced families and secondary school girls at Yerwa Government Girls School.","Education"
"“Nigeria is the richest country in Africa, but has more girls out of school than any country in the world,” said Yousafzai. “Studies are clear — educating girls grows economies, reduces conflict and improves public health. For these girls and for their country’s future, Nigeria’s leaders must immediately prioritise education.”","Education"
"Over 2,295 teachers have been killed and 19,000 displaced, and almost 1,400 schools destroyed since the start of the Boko Haram insurgency in 2009. Three million children in the northeast are in need of support to keep learning.","Education"
"While the 90 camps and camp-like settings in Maiduguri house thousands of families, more than three-quarters of the 600,000-plus displaced people are living with family, relatives or friends in host communities, placing an additional burden on local schools.","Education"
"Beyond the crisis in the northeast, Nigeria already had the largest number of children out of school in the world – over 10.5 million. Among primary school-aged children not in school, only five per cent are dropouts: three-quarters of them will never step foot in a classroom, and the majority are girls.","Education"
"Across West Africa, 46 per cent of primary school-aged children not in school are Nigerian. Globally, one in five children not enrolled are Nigerian.","Education"
"“We will do everything in our power to make sure all children can keep learning. We believe that education – especially for girls, is the single most important way to bring hope, peace and prosperity not just for this generation, but for also for future generations,” said Mohamed Malick Fall, UNICEF’s Representative in Nigeria.","Education"
"UNICEF is working closely with the government and partners to put children in the northeast back into learning environments. More than 525,000 have been enrolled in school this year alone, over 37 temporary learning spaces established, and almost 92,000 packs of learning material distributed to help children continue their education.","Education"

"Malala Yousafzai is a Pakistani activist, student, UN Messenger of Peace and the youngest person ever awarded the Nobel Peace Prize. At age 15, she was shot by the Taliban for speaking out against their ban on girls’ education.

"On 7 March 2017 at 11:00 am, Jolita, 26, gave birth to a healthy baby girl named Tania in one of Medair’s cyclone shelters in Madagascar during Cyclone Enawo, which struck the northeast coast of Madagascar that day with Category 4 force.","Shelter and Non-Food Items"
"“My water broke the day before. We knew we couldn’t stay in our house – warnings about Cyclone Enawo were going out. I was very anxious. I wanted to be in a safe place for my very first delivery, especially if it was going to happen during a cyclone! We knew the cyclone shelter was our best option.”","Shelter and Non-Food Items"
"Jolita is one of 200 people in the village of Ambinanitelo who found refuge in one of Medair’s cyclone shelters when Cyclone Enawo hit. The following days, heavy rains caused destructive floods, leaving her village under three metres of water.","Shelter and Non-Food Items"
"Right after Cyclone Enawo’s passage, Medair travelled to the devastated areas to assess the needs of the people affected, and to distribute emergency water and sanitation kits and disinfect contaminated wells. Alfred Ralaimboa, 40, was part of a Medair team that went to Jolita’s village. “When we arrived, Jolita’s cyclone shelter was completely full,” Alfred remembers. “In other villages, people were so desperate to find refuge that the number of people in the shelter far exceeded the recommended capacity. In one village, 380 people stayed in the cyclone shelter!”","Shelter and Non-Food Items"
"People told the Medair teams that many lives had been saved because of the shelters, which Medair had built between 2011 and 2013. Alfred had supervised the construction of seven of those shelters. He felt real joy and pride when he saw that the shelters had played such a crucial role in keeping so many people safe.","Shelter and Non-Food Items"
"“Although the district of Maroantsetra is often hit by cyclones, flooding is what makes this area particularly vulnerable,” he explains. “When a cyclone hits, the heavy rains are trapped in this basin and the whole area quickly floods. This region is the wettest in Madagascar ̶ 3,000 ml of rain a year!”","Shelter and Non-Food Items"
"The Medair shelters are five years old now. The communities have tried to maintain them, but many need to be rehabilitated. “We want to avoid an accident the next time the communities use the shelters,” says Alfred. “Rotten wood needs to be changed and foundations need to be reinforced. The doors must be repaired and the locks changed. In several, the latrines and water reservoirs need to be repaired.”","Shelter and Non-Food Items"
"By the next cyclone season in November 2017, Medair will rehabilitate 11 shelters. Alfred is supervising the rehabilitation work of four of them, including the one in Jolita’s village.

"This report presents the findings of an independent evaluation for the USAID/Food for Peace-funded project implemented by Action Against Hunger in Yobe State in April 2016 – July 2017. This project was aimed at improving the nutrition security and addressing the humanitarian crisis-affected populations in four Local Government Areas of Yobe State by addressing the food security of vulnerable households, especially women and children, through an integrated cash transfer scheme (increase immediate food consumption for food-insecure households) and behaviour change interventions (adoption of optimal infant/young child feeding practices by caregivers).","Food and Nutrition"
"This evaluation uses the OECD-DAC guidelines and principles to assess the performance of the project according to a set of standardised criteria. Based on the findings, this report presents a set of recommendations and best practices to guide the implementation of future projects.","Food and Nutrition"
"**Relevance/Appropriateness**: The relevance of Action Against Hunger response has been very high both from a geographical angle and from the perspective of the beneficiaries’ profile (assisting the most vulnerable). The two project components corresponded to the population’s priorities and hence set to achieve the expected results. The modalities have been relevant in adapting to current local emergency contexts and cultural traditions in the area and successfully addressing beneficiary needs (increase immediate food consumption) and adoption of Infant and Young Child Feeding (IYCF) practices by caregivers. However, the termination of the project during the lean period has left many beneficiaries in precarious food security conditions.","Food and Nutrition"
"**Coherence**: Good working relationships between Action Against Hunger and State and non-state stakeholders created an enabling environment for learning and adaptation. Action Against Hunger’s role as an active member of the Cash Working Group (CWG) and the Food Security and Livelihoods Working Group (FSLWG) has influenced CWG progress from an information sharing platform towards discussion, coordination and joint decision-making. The project is overall coherent with the broader Action Against Hunger strategy and is widely integrated with other Action Against Hunger activities; project staff have a clear understanding of working towards a common goal, which goes beyond the specific project objectives.","Food and Nutrition"
"**Coverage**: The selection of the final beneficiaries was done through a two-stage process of undertaking a household ‘census’ out of which the most vulnerable ones were selected based on set Food Security and Livelihood (FSL) sector agreed criteria, which portrays an appropriate targeting of beneficiaries. Although the needs far exceeded the funding available, the geographical coverage was fair while influenced by access and security constraints, and beneficiary selection was adequate and fair including gender –sensitive activities.","Food and Nutrition"
"**Efficiency**: Action Against Hunger systems and processes are solid and consistently applied to the project. The smart-card system, despite lack of knowledge on the technological aspects, was positively perceived by the beneficiaries as it ensured privacy, security and control mechanisms","Food and Nutrition"

"“We are at a crossroads,” said Christopher Hoffman, World Vision’s humanitarian response director in East Africa. “People have responded to the heartbreaking needs of children, but we are still in the danger zone. More than 800,000 children remain severely malnourished and are at risk of starving to death. We have months, maybe only weeks, to stop this from happening.”","Food and Nutrition"
"Drought in Somalia, Ethiopia and Kenya, along with conflict in South Sudan and other parts of the region has led thousands of children below the age 5 into severe acute malnutrition, a fatal condition if untreated.","Food and Nutrition"
"“We’re seeing emaciated children, nearly skeletons, lying in pain in hospital beds. Things we should never see in 2017. We’re seeing mothers unable to breastfeed because they are malnourished themselves. The hunger crisis is wreaking havoc on 24 million people here – more than the population of Berlin, London, Chicago and Bangkok combined,” Hoffman said.","Food and Nutrition"
"In recent weeks, Ethiopia, Somalia and Kenya have reported a spike in malnutrition rates among children, with several areas now reporting that more than a third of their children are suffering health problems from a lack of access to nutritious food.","Food and Nutrition"
"The warning comes as World Vision reports that, thanks to its supporters and government donors around the world, it has reached more than three million people with emergency assistance ranging from food packages and emergency school supplies, to drought-resistant seeds, farming tools and access to clean water.","Food and Nutrition"
"“We are humbled and encouraged by the difference we have been able to make with the money entrusted to us,” said Hoffman. “But it takes a lot more than World Vision to stop this tragedy in its tracks.","Food and Nutrition"

"World Vision is appealing for an additional $57 million US to reach another 3 million people in the next six months. Among the 24 million impacted by drought and conflict in eastern Africa, UNICEF notes that 15.1 million children are being impacted by the ongoing drought and conflict in eastern Africa, with 4.3 million children being impacted in South Sudan, 3.7 million in Somalia, 5.4 million in Ethiopia and 1.7 million in Kenya.","Food and Nutrition"
"Conflict is preventing food from reaching many areas of the country, leading to a hunger crisis being experienced by 6 million people – half of the country’s population. More than 840,000 children have been identified as acutely malnourished, with 270,000 struggling with severe acute malnutrition.","Food and Nutrition"
"Drought in north and eastern Kenya is affecting 3.4 million people who require food assistance and clean water. In August, a coalition of humanitarian agencies including World Vision raised alarm about a spike in malnutrition rates, with more than 420,000 children requiring urgent treatment to address acute malnutrition, with 83,000 struggling with severe acute malnutrition.","Food and Nutrition"
"A two-year hunger crisis, caused by low and erratic rainfall in the south and eastern parts of the country, has pushed up to 8.5 million people into crisis and in urgent need of humanitarian assistance. In August 2017, the Ethiopian government announced that 3.6 million children, pregnant women and breastfeeding mothers need nutrition assistance to prevent a malnutrition crisis in the next six months. The government predicted that 375,000 children under age 5 will be severely malnourished by the end of 2017.","Food and Nutrition"
"A two-year drought, coupled with ongoing insecurity in Somalia, has led to a hunger crisis affecting 6.2 million people across the country. In August 2017, the number of malnourished children increased by 20,000, with a warning that 1.4 million children are at risk of experiencing acute malnutrition by the end of year if more humanitarian assistance was not made available.

"The number of hungry and malnourished people is [rising](http://www.fao.org/news/story/en/item/1037253/icode/) for the first time in over a decade. This is according to the United Nation’s Food and Agriculture Organisation. There are now [815 million](http://www.who.int/mediacentre/news/releases/2017/world-hunger-report/en/) people affected and frequent incidents of acute and widespread food shortages remain. The UN also recently warned that 20 million people are at [immediate risk](https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/world/2017-famines/) of dying of hunger. There are four countries at particular risk: Yemen 10 million, Nigeria (North East) 4-6 million, South Sudan 4-6 million, and Somalia 2-4 million. A further 18 countries are suffering a high magnitude of food insecurity.","Food and Nutrition"
"But understandable emotion aside, are we sure that we really understand hunger and malnutrition, or what is known as food insecurity? What are the factors behind the numbers rising? Is it due to climate change, with more droughts happening? Is it over population? Is it degradation of the planet leading to desertification, pollution and deforestation? Or does violence play the biggest role?","Food and Nutrition"
"To begin to answer these questions it’s important to understand the context, the causes and possible solutions.","Food and Nutrition"
"Hungry people suffer however their situation is labelled. Unfortunately, politicians are more likely to act in the case of a famine, where people are dying of starvation, than for the hunger that accompanies long-term food insecurity. This is because famine reaches the headlines, whereas hunger and chronic under-nutrition are below the media’s radar. But arguably the distinction is artificial and unhelpful.","Food and Nutrition"
"In 2004, the [Integrated Food Security Phase Classification Global Partners](http://www.fao.org/docrep/010/i0275e/i0275e.pdf) launched a classification of food insecurity for use in Somalia. After it was tested internationally it was later officially adopted by the United Nations. Level 5 of this scale is “catastrophe” and famines are now declared when the technical criteria are met. [These are](http://www.fews.net/IPC) that; at least one in five households face an extreme lack of food, more than 30% of the population is suffering from acute malnutrition (wasting) and at least two people out of every 10,000 are dying each day.","Food and Nutrition"
"In 2011 there was one [in Somalia](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-22380352) and in February of 2017 another [in South Sudan](https://www.vox.com/world/2017/6/1/15653970/south-sudan-hunger-crisis-famine). The UN is being sparing in its use of “famine” but Level 3 “crisis” and Level 4 “emergency” food insecurity in theory should trigger urgent action. It is frustrating that semantics matter so much and that donors are still slow to act.","Food and Nutrition"
"The causes of famine and food insecurity are multiple. In the past they have been seen [principally](https://theconversation.com/the-relationship-between-drought-and-famine-lessons-from-the-horn-of-africa-84294) as the result of natural disasters that reduce food production or interrupt trade. But towards the end of the 20th Century it became increasingly clear that the failure of institutions, especially political and economic, and the [degradation](http://www.ugapress.org/index.php/books/silent_violence) of traditional customs of mutual support were also heavily involved.","Food and Nutrition"
"Symptoms of these developments [include](http://www.tandfebooks.com/isbn/9780203014424) poor governance, failing states, corruption and dysfunctional markets. It is therefore no surprise that the countries suffering from famine all suffer from one, if not all, of these to varying degrees. The starving children in Yemen, Nigeria, South Sudan and Somalia are not victims of drought. Rather dysfunctional states, which manifests as conflict in its most extreme, are the present cause of famines.","Food and Nutrition"
"Although politics brings about famines, natural disasters are certainly part of the background, reducing food production and challenging the resilience of individuals, households and wider social groups. We all face the prospect of climate change and the question is whether this will contribute to worsening food insecurity for poor people in Africa and Asia.","Food and Nutrition"
"It’s predicted [that more](http://www.ipcc.ch/pdf/assessment-report/ar5/wg2/WGIIAR5-Chap7_FINAL.pdf) vulnerable environments will develop as a consequence of global warming. It seems particularly likely this will happen in the Asian monsoon and that in Africa and the Mediterranean aridity will spread. This will increase the vulnerability of people living in poor countries that are densely populated. As climate change modelling becomes more sophisticated, the [consensus](http://www.fao.org/3/a-i6030e.pdf) is that this type of famine risk will increase over the coming decades.","Food and Nutrition"
"A crucial anti-famine strategy is investing in science to provide early warnings. The most important large-scale monitoring programme is [Famine Early Warning Systems Network](http://www.fews.net/), which is now operating in 34 countries using evidence-based analysis of data from livelihood zones, climatic data, satellite images of drought, food prices and trade data.","Food and Nutrition"
"Another major development that’s needed is investment in infrastructure and agriculture. Countries [such as](http://ebrary.ifpri.org/utils/getfile/collection/p15738coll2/id/127347/filename/127558.pdf) Bangladesh and Ethiopia have hauled themselves out of the mire of food insecurity by investing in agriculture, markets, roads and communications.","Food and Nutrition"
"Other countries, for instance Botswana, Namibia and South Africa are now taking up the policy of [“social protection”](http://bulletin.ids.ac.uk/idsbo/article/view/2783/ONLINE%20ARTICLE) where regular and predictable support – such as such as weather-indexed insurance, public works programmes, emergency food aid and buffer stock management – is provided to vulnerable people before famine shocks, such as civil conflict, bad harvests, transport disruption or drought, occur.","Food and Nutrition"
"If policymakers don’t come forward with these or other solutions, acute food insecurity and chronic under-nutrition will last as long as ultra-poverty persists, especially among marginalised groups in marginal environments.","Food and Nutrition"
"Yes, famine and food insecurity are complex and their solution definitely comes into the difficult category. But we now realise that hunger is not inevitable and that we have a moral duty to solve it as soon as possible. The only thing missing is the political will.","Food and Nutrition"

The region is facing a monumental hunger crisis with 24 million people affected in Ethiopia, Kenya, Somalia and South Sudan. More than 15 million children in the region are facing health risks due to ongoing drought and insecurity. Of them approximately 800,000 are severely malnourished and at risk of starvation. This largely pastoral region has been hit particularly hard by drought which resulted in an immense loss of livestock. ","Food and Nutrition"
"A prolonged drought in the south and east regions of Ethiopia, which began two years ago, is affecting 8.5 million people. These conditions are not expected to improve as the October-December rains are expected to be below normal, leaving the country with little chance of recovery. Drought in the north and east regions of Kenya left 3.4 million people in need of food aid and clean water. Somalia has also faced a two-year long drought. Coupled with insecurity, this hunger crisis is affecting 6.2 million people in the country. In South Sudan, half of the population – approximately 6 million people – is facing a hunger crisis. This has been exacerbated by conflict preventing food aid from reaching the affected people. ","Food and Nutrition"

Serious levels of acute malnutrition were also recorded in the regions of Kayes (14.2%) and Taoudéni (14.3%), while the national rate is 10.7%.","Food and Nutrition"
"“Behind these figures are the lives of the most vulnerable and forgotten girls and boys in Mali,” said UNICEF Representative Lucia Elmi. “We must provide life-saving treatment and ensure each and every one of these children can fully recover. At the same time, we need to invest in the critical first 1000 days of the lives of children to reduce the risk of acute malnutrition from occurring in the first place.”","Food and Nutrition"
"An estimated 165,000 children are expected to suffer from severe acute malnutrition across the country in 2018. Children who suffer from the severe form of acute malnutrition have grave muscle wasting, very low weight for their height, and are nine times more likely to die in case of disease due to a weakened immune system.","Food and Nutrition"
"Since the 2012 political and security crisis in Mali, violence and instability have led to displacements of population and disruption of social services in the north of the country, with detrimental impact on the nutritional status of the most vulnerable girls and boys. Other factors, such as limited access to water and sanitation in northern areas and childhood diseases like diarrhea, acute respiratory infections and malaria, have aggravated the situation.","Food and Nutrition"
"Investing in the first 1000 days of a child, through promotion of practices such as exclusive breastfeeding for the first six months and handwashing with clean water and soap, can effectively prevent malnutrition.","Food and Nutrition"
"“It is vital to take on a long-term outlook to address malnutrition in the Sahel,” said Noël Zagré, UNICEF Regional Nutrition Advisor for West and Central Africa. “Efforts need to be intensified to build the resilience of families through improved food security, prevention and treatment of severe acute malnutrition, access to water and sanitation, and knowledge of key family practices such as breastfeeding.”","Food and Nutrition"

The report confirmed that despite significant progress, Lao PDR has some of the highest rates of malnutrition in South East Asia, with more than one third of children under five (35.6 percent) suffering from stunting or chronic malnutrition.  ","Food and Nutrition"
"The Fill the Nutrient Gap report contains an analysis of the nutrition situation in Lao PDR, compares the potential impact of interventions, and identifies programme and policy entry points to ensure consumption of an adequately nutritious diet.  ","Food and Nutrition"
"“This report supports the implementation of the National Nutrition Strategy, Plan of Action to reduce the levels of chronic malnutrition to 25% by 2025,” said the Minister of Health, Associate Prof. Dr. Syhavong Bounkong, “good nutrition in the first 1000 days of life is vital to meet these goals”. ","Food and Nutrition"
"The first 1,000 days refers to the ‘window of opportunity’ from a child’s conception through to her second birthday. Inadequate nutrition during this time can irreversibly hamper cognitive and physical development.","Food and Nutrition"
"Key findings show that while nutritious food is available across the country, many people cannot afford it. In fact, the cost of a nutritious diet varies significantly across the country, and the report shows that when people can’t afford a basic staple diet, stunting rates are higher. Furthermore, it is more expensive to give adolescent girls and pregnant and breastfeeding women an adequate diet, because they need specific, more nutritious food. ","Food and Nutrition"
"“While great progress has been made over recent years in Lao PDR to decrease levels of chronic malnutrition, the report highlights the challenges on the road ahead. The recommendations made in the report will assist the country to work towards the elimination of all forms of malnutrition and meet the Sustainable Development Goal targets,” said Sarah Gordon-Gibson, WFP Country Director and Representative. ","Food and Nutrition"
"The report provides a detailed review of nutrition, dietary intake, food security, household food expenditure, and socio-economic status of the population. It will facilitate future decision-making by the government and all partners to improve the quality and access to nutritious food, especially during the critical period of the initial 1,000 days of life.","Food and Nutrition"
"The key recommendations include focusing on both nutrition-specific and nutrition-sensitive interventions targeting the initial 1000 days of life. The report also suggests developing strategies to improve nutrient intake of adolescent girls; explore food fortification options; and engage in social behavior change communication. Improved diet diversity and quality of food would result in greater nutritional benefits; however, is only possible through maintaining a high level of political and financial commitment.

"The monsoon season is crucial for agricultural production, and a year with too little rain can spell disaster. But the summer rains also cause devastation each year, from landslides in the mountains to flooding in the plains.

"The flooding has affected many of the South Areas of Nepal where more people live and there is a greater concentration of poverty. Two districts, Rautahat and Saptari, were severely affected with 79% of the districts’ total population in need of assistance. Almost 15% of the flooding casualties were from these districts.

"When the flooding and landslides began Alliance2015 partners in Nepal immediately activated the Joint Emergency Preparedness Plan. Concern Worldwide, Welthungerhilfe, and People in Need, along with their local partners, deployed teams to Rautahat and Saptari. _“Thanks to our advance planning, Alliance partners were able to immediately dispatch emergency stocks to 250 affected households less than a week after the rains had stopped,”_ says Eileen Morrow, Country Director for Concern Worldwide. _“But flooding has been extensive and many households are in need of urgent assistance.”_","Food and Nutrition"
"As the flood waters began to recede, Alliance2015 partners rapidly dispatched additional staff on the ground to expand their response. _“We decided to focus our relief efforts in these two districts because they have some of the highest rates of poverty in the country and have been among the most affected areas. _Relief assistance has also been slow to reach these areas because flood waters destroyed bridges and covered roads,”_ says People in Need’s Country Director, Daniel Coyle. ","Food and Nutrition"
"The south, where the majority of Nepalis live, is also the country’s “rice bowl.” Initial estimates suggest a loss of 80% of agricultural productivity, a huge concern for food security across the country.  Sita Devi (60) is among thousands of people who lost their crops storage when the water entered their houses. _“While we were returning back from the field, we found our house submerged in water.

"**Trump Administration Should Publish Policy, Strengthen Protections**","Protection and Human Rights"
"(Washington, DC) – US President Donald Trump’s [reported rule changes for targeting terrorism suspects](https://mobile.nytimes.com/2017/10/28/us/politics/aumf-congress-niger.html?smid=tw-share&_r=0&referer=) increase the risk of drone strikes killing civilians, Human Rights Watch said today. The Trump administration should immediately publish its new policy on targeted killings outside conventional battlefields and strengthen protection for civilians.","Protection and Human Rights"
"“Trump’s reported changes for targeting terrorism suspects will result in more civilian deaths with less oversight and greater secrecy,” said [Letta Tayler](https://www.hrw.org/about/people/letta-tayler), senior terrorism and counterterrorism researcher at Human Rights Watch. “The US should be increasing civilian protections off the battlefield, not dismantling them.”","Protection and Human Rights"
"The New York Times reported on October 28, 2017, that Trump recently approved new rules that dismantle much of the [Presidential Policy Guidance](https://www.justice.gov/oip/foia-library/procedures_for_approving_direct_action_against_terrorist_targets/download) on targeted killings issued in 2013 by then-President Barack Obama. The Times did not give a date for the rule changes, which the Trump administration has neither denied nor publicly acknowledged.","Protection and Human Rights"
"The report said that the revised rules scrap the Obama-era requirement that anyone targeted for attack outside of what the US calls “areas of active hostilities” must pose a “continuing, imminent threat” to American lives. This change gives US forces greater latitude to attack people it considers lower-level members of armed groups such as the Islamic State (also known as ISIS), al-Qaeda, the Taliban, and so-called “associated forces,” rather than primarily targeting these groups’ top echelons.","Protection and Human Rights"
"The change also means the US may strike in countries where armed groups are present but not actively plotting attacks against the US. These changes are problematic because the US is loosening rules for taking human life in circumstances in which it is uncertain that the US is engaged in an armed conflict, Human Rights Watch said.","Protection and Human Rights"
"The report said that the revisions also end the Obama administration’s requirement for top-level, interagency vetting of each drone strike or special forces operation outside of conventional theaters of war such as Iraq, Syria, and Afghanistan. Instead, the rules now apparently allow the US to conduct a “persistent campaign of direct action” in countries where terrorism suspects may be operating, without top-level sign-off for individual attacks.","Protection and Human Rights"
"The reported changes replace a requirement that US forces have “near-certainty” that the target is present before carrying out a strike or a raid with a “reasonable certainty” threshold, increasing the possibility that civilians could be unlawfully killed or injured. Even when the US makes robust efforts to attack at times and in places with the least likelihood of civilian harm, such operations can result in unintended deaths because of factors such as faulty intelligence or unpredictable events on the ground.","Protection and Human Rights"
"Trump did not rescind a requirement for “near-certainty” that no civilians would be killed or injured in an operation, the report said. But Human Rights Watch field research during the Obama administration found that the US did not always appear to follow this requirement anyway.","Protection and Human Rights"
"Obama unveiled his Presidential Policy Guidance amid mounting criticism over the US targeted-killing program. The US [says](https://www.dni.gov/index.php/newsroom/reports-publications/item/1741-summary-of-information-regarding-u-s-counterterrorism-strikes-outside-areas-of-active-hostilities) it killed as many as 3,100 people from 2009 to 2016 in targeted-killing operations in Pakistan, Somalia, Yemen, and elsewhere – some civil society groups argue that the number is higher. Yet it has provided [scant information on combatant and civilian casualties](https://www.outoftheshadowsreport.com/executive-summary/) and the legality of particular attacks. Trump has continued the program, which relies primarily on drone strikes, and [reportedly](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/africa/u-s-now-moving-toward-armed-drones-lethal-force-niger-n814341) is poised to expand it to areas including Mali and Niger, where US forces are engaged in counterterrorism operations.","Protection and Human Rights"
"The US targeted-killing rules are policy directives, not law. Although they are more protective of human life than the international laws of war, they remain insufficient where the US has not demonstrated it is engaged in an armed conflict, Human Rights Watch said. Absent an armed conflict, law-enforcement rules governed by international human rights law apply. In such circumstances, lethal force may only be used to protect an imminent threat to life.","Protection and Human Rights"
"The US contends that it can use military force anywhere against targeted groups without regard to whether its attacks take place in an area of active hostilities, arguing that it is engaged in an armed conflict without geographical boundaries with groups like ISIS and al-Qaeda. That interpretation is overly broad and dangerous.","Protection and Human Rights"
"“The Trump administration’s reported widening of its rules for targeted killings opens the door for more US attacks on civilians,” Tayler said. “It also sends a message to all countries acquiring armed drones that they too can try to bend international law when taking human life in the name of countering terrorism.”","Protection and Human Rights"

"As the storm approached the family sought shelter with their neighbors on the upper floors of their house – they watched as their ground-floor apartment quickly filled with water from the overflowing river nearby. Moments later, the wall of the room they were sheltering in collapsed. Trevor Jean rushed his children to the only safe place he could think of.","Protection and Human Rights"

"After almost 50 years of taking in hundreds of thousands of refugees from various neighboring states, Cameroon is shredding its reputation as a generous refugee-hosting country. Working to push back Nigeria’s militant Islamist group Boko Haram, which has secured an increasingly violent foothold in northern Cameroon since 2013, Cameroon’s military deems tens of thousands of Nigerian asylum seekers a threat to their security goal and has carried out a policy of mass forced return of this vulnerable population. The Cameroonian military’s aim seems to be to clear Nigerians out of the country and dissuade other would-be asylum seekers from seeking Cameroon’s protection.","Protection and Human Rights"
"Since early 2015, the Cameroonian authorities have summarily deported at least 100,000 Nigerians living in remote border areas back to war, displacement, and destitution in Nigeria’s Borno State. At least 4,402 are known to have been deported in the first seven and a half months of 2017. In carrying out these deportations, Cameroonian soldiers have frequently used extreme physical violence. Some, including children, weakened after living for months or years without adequate food and medical care in border areas, have died during or just after the deportations, and children have been separated from their parents.","Protection and Human Rights"
"The forced returns are a flagrant breach of the principle of nonrefoulement, binding on Cameroon under national Cameroonian as well as international law. They are also being carried out in defiance of UNHCR’s late 2016 plea to all governments not to return anyone to northeastern Nigeria “until the security and human rights situation has improved considerably.”","Protection and Human Rights"
"Since early 2015, Cameroon’s army has been aggressively screening newly arriving Nigerians at the border, subjecting some to torture and other forms of abuse, and containing them in far-flung and under-serviced border villages and informal refugee settlements, to which the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) has been denied access. This policy of blocking asylum seekers from accessing protection has made it easier for Cameroon to deport them.","Protection and Human Rights"
"About 70,000 refugees able to reach Cameroon’s only designated camp for Nigerian refugees, in Minawao, have also faced violence at the hands of Cameroonian soldiers, have had limited access to food and water and are subject to abusive restrictions on their right to free movement. In April and May 2017, 13,000 returned from the camp to Nigeria, some of whom were killed in early September after Boko Haram attacked the Banki displacement camp where many had ended up.","Protection and Human Rights"
"To avoid complying with their basic obligations under refugee law to provide protection and assistance for tens of thousands of Nigerians seeking asylum in Cameroon, the authorities have refused to allow UNHCR to register their asylum claims and to process them for refugee protection in the border areas or, except in a few exceptional cases, to arrange for their transfer to Minawao where UNHCR can register them.","Protection and Human Rights"
"As of mid-2017, UNHCR had only been given sporadic access to some border communities to carry out basic pre-registration procedures, likely leaving tens of thousands of asylum seekers without access to protection and putting them at risk of unlawful forced return. The agency has repeatedly and unsuccessfully asked Cameroon to set up new transit centers to register newly arriving asylum seekers.","Protection and Human Rights"
"After staying publicly silent on the situation for two years, in late March 2017, UNHCR started to publicly criticize the authorities for their mass forced refugee returns. The decision to go public was triggered by ongoing forced returns, even after Cameroon had signed an agreement in early March with Nigeria and UNHCR committing both countries to voluntary refugee returns. As of mid-July, evidence on the ground confirmed that Cameroon has continued to unlawfully deport hundreds of asylum seekers at a time, although formally the authorities deny this.","Protection and Human Rights"
"On one occasion in late June 2017, the Nigerian authorities responded to Cameroon’s pressure by sending military vehicles over the border to help Cameroon deport almost 1,000 asylum seekers. Nigeria thereby became complicit in the unlawful forced return of its own citizens.","Protection and Human Rights"
"In late June and July 2017, Human Rights Watch interviewed 61 refugees and asylum seekers in Nigeria about the abuses they had suffered in Cameroon.","Protection and Human Rights"
"Those previously living in Cameroon’s border areas, particularly in or near Kolofata and Mora, spoke of shocking levels of physical violence perpetrated by Cameroonian soldiers between early 2015 and April 2017. They described how soldiers tortured and assaulted them and dozens of others on arrival and during screening procedures, accusing them of belonging to Boko Haram or being “Boko Haram wives.” They said soldiers closely controlled their daily movements, beating and extorting money under threat of detention and deportation as they tried to collect firewood. UNHCR says it has received similar reports from asylum seekers living in the border areas.","Protection and Human Rights"
"Asylum seekers also described to Human Rights Watch poor humanitarian conditions in the border areas, including limited access to food, and how they struggled to keep themselves and their families alive in the face of destitution exacerbated by exploitation. One woman described how soldiers promised to give women food and not deport them in exchange for sex with them.","Protection and Human Rights"
"Every person interviewed said that during their time in border villages, Cameroonian soldiers regularly rounded up dozens or hundreds of fellow asylum seekers, brutally beat them with wooden sticks and metal poles to force them onto trucks, and deported them. Some said they witnessed soldiers deporting dozens of groups involving hundreds of people. After living in constant fear of deportation, they then described how they suffered the same fate. Many said they saw other deportees, including malnourished children, die during their deportation.","Protection and Human Rights"
"Refugees previously and currently living in the Minawao refugee camp told Human Rights Watch about severe violence they suffered in the camp, particularly in 2015 when soldiers beat them and hundreds of other refugees during food distribution in the camp, resulting in deaths and injuries. Some also said soldiers severely beat them and others in 2016 and 2017, for example when they intercepted them as they attempted to collect firewood outside the camp, and tried to extort money from them.","Protection and Human Rights"
"Refugees who had lived in the camp spoke of poor humanitarian conditions there since 2015, including a reduction in food rations and a lack of clean water. Some also said they struggled to access adequate healthcare. Many said these conditions had pushed thousands to leave the camp and return to Nigeria in April and May 2017. However, in April 2017 water access significantly improved and the United Nations (UN) said it hoped to resume full food rations in October for three months.","Protection and Human Rights"
"On August 7, Human Rights Watch wrote to Cameroon’s Minister of Territorial Administration and Decentralization outlining this report’s findings and requesting comment. As of mid-September, we had received no response.","Protection and Human Rights"
"After the deportees are forced back to their country, the Nigerian army transfers them to militarized displacement camps or villages in Borno State where conditions are dire, and women and girls face sexual exploitation. These sites are in the midst of the ongoing conflict between Nigeria’s armed forces and Boko Haram which has displaced about 2 million other Nigerian civilians struggling to survive the violence.","Protection and Human Rights"
"The UN and aid groups in Nigeria have repeatedly appealed for an end to forced returns from Cameroon, saying it is too dangerous and that they do not have the capacity to respond to the massive needs of returnees. They have also called on the Nigerian authorities—who have repeatedly overstated limited improvements in the security situation in Borno—not to carry out plans to set up new displacement camps in insecure areas to deal with the mass returns from Cameroon.","Protection and Human Rights"
"International refugee and human rights law prohibits refoulement, the forcible return of refugees to persecution, and the forcible return of anyone, regardless of their legal status, to a real risk of torture. In addition, African regional refugee law prohibits the return of civilians to situations of generalized violence, such as the one that exists in northeastern Nigeria. Cameroon has bound itself to these prohibitions and incorporated them into Cameroonian law.","Protection and Human Rights"
"Cameroon has the right to regulate the presence of non-nationals on its territory and to prevent certain people from entering or remaining in Cameroon—including those viewed as a threat to its national security, such as members of Boko Haram. The authorities also have an obligation to carefully investigate any attacks carried out in the Far North Region by suspected Cameroonian or Nigerian members of Boko Haram.","Protection and Human Rights"
"However, Cameroon’s right to prevent individuals shown to pose a security threat from entering Cameroon does not mean the authorities may close their borders to asylum seekers, or block them from seeking asylum in Cameroon and then summarily deport them, or registered refugees, back to Nigeria. The failure to protect refugees and other abuses documented in this report appear to be driven by the Cameroonian government’s arbitrary decision to punish Nigerian refugees, based solely on their nationality, for Boko Haram attacks carried out in Cameroon’s Far North Region and to discourage Nigerians from seeking asylum in Cameroon.","Protection and Human Rights"
"Cameroon is also bound by its own laws and international law not to limit asylum seekers’ and refugees’ freedom of movement. However, the mid 2015 decision to require Nigerian refugees to live and remain in the Minawao camp to receive refugee status and assistance fails to comply with the limited permitted exceptions to this rule.","Protection and Human Rights"
"As of late July 2017, international donors had funded less than ten percent of UNHCR’s appeals for their Cameroonian operations on behalf of refugees from the Central African Republic and Nigeria. This significant shortfall risks sending Cameroon a message that donor governments do not care what happens to Nigerian refugees and that Cameroon should deal with the significant challenges it faces in protecting and assisting refugees on its own. This is unlikely to encourage the authorities to be tolerant of Nigerian refugees and stop abusing them.","Protection and Human Rights"
"To help put an immediate end to the abuses described in this report, the Cameroonian and Nigerian authorities, the African Commission on Human and Peoples’ Rights, the United Nations, including UNHCR, and donor countries should take a number of urgent steps.","Protection and Human Rights"
"The Cameroonian authorities should immediately instruct the military authorities to stop deporting Nigerian asylum seekers and refugees and should investigate and prosecute any soldiers who have committed acts of violence against asylum seekers and other abuses. They should swiftly register Nigerian asylum seekers, recognize those who pass security screening procedures as refugees, and let them live in Cameroonian communities or refugee camps that respect their right to free movement.","Protection and Human Rights"
"In line with UNHCR’s official position on returns to Nigeria, the Nigerian authorities should unambiguously and publicly recognize that the security and humanitarian situation in Borno State means that it remains unsafe for Nigerian refugees to return from Cameroon.","Protection and Human Rights"
"UNHCR should maintain its June 2017 decision to publicly report every month on forced returns from Cameroon and should include in those reports information on Cameroonian military abuses against Nigerian refugees and asylum seekers. UNHCR should also transparently report on the extent to which the Cameroonian authorities allow UNHCR to register asylum seekers living in Cameroon’s border areas with Nigeria and assist them in those areas or transport them to the Minawao camp.","Protection and Human Rights"
"The Special Rapporteur on Refugees, Asylum Seekers, Internally Displaced Persons and Migrants in Africa of the African Commission on Human and Peoples’ Rights should call on Cameroon to immediately end the abuses set out in this report, request to visit Cameroon’s border areas with Nigeria and the Minawao camp, and issue a public report on the extent of abuses faced by asylum seekers and refugees.","Protection and Human Rights"
"Finally, donor governments should immediately improve on their extremely weak response in 2017 to UNHCR’s financial appeals for Nigerian refugees in Cameroon and other countries in the region. They should also raise the abuses set out in this report with the Cameroonian authorities, call on them to put an immediate end to these practices and to fully cooperate with UNHCR in assisting and protecting all Nigerian asylum seekers and refugees in Cameroon.","Protection and Human Rights"
"The Committee on the Rights of the Child today concluded its consideration of the initial report of Guinea under the Optional Protocol on the involvement of children in armed conflict and the initial report under the Optional Protocol on the sale of children, child prostitution and child pornography.","Protection and Human Rights"
"Sékou Konaté, Director for Children’s Affairs at the Ministry of Social Affairs, Advancement of Women and Children’s Affairs, said that the respect for the rights of the child had always been at the centre of the country’s concerns, and that those rights were proclaimed in the Constitution and expressed more explicitly in the legislative and regulatory texts intended to protect the children and punish the perpetrators of violations.  The country had paid a heavy price in the face of the epidemic of Ebola haemorrhagic fever, which had increased the vulnerability of children.  The Government had signed 12 commitments to reduce child poverty by 2019 and the national child policy had been updated to take account of developments in the situation.  The Child Code Act had been revised with a view to aligning it with other legal texts as part of the reform of the justice sector. ","Protection and Human Rights"
"Following the ratification of the Optional Protocol on the involvement of children in armed conflict in 2001, Guinea had taken steps to prohibit the recruitment of persons under the age of 18 and their direct involvement in armed conflict.  The provisions of the Children's Code protected and afforded all possible guarantees to refugee children affected by armed conflict.  The provisions of the Optional Protocol had been taken into account both in the Constitution and in the Child Code Act. ","Protection and Human Rights"
"With regards to the sale of children, child prostitution and child pornography, the Child Code had been harmonized with the Convention on the Rights of the Child, conventions 138 and 182 of the International Labour Organization and other instruments, and Guinea was a party to numerous bilateral and regional treaties on combating trafficking in persons.  A new child policy had been set up, to be implemented through triennial action plans, and would focus on prevention and caring for children victims of abuse, exploitation, neglect and violence.  The fight against the sale of children, the worst forms of child labour, trafficking and sexual violence against children were among the priorities for the Government of Guinea.","Protection and Human Rights"
"During the dialogue, Experts acknowledged progress in the implementation of the Optional Protocol on the involvement of children in armed conflict and asked about the efforts to disseminate its provisions, data collection and coordination, trainings of peacekeepers, military school curricula, and birth registration.  Particular attention was given to the demobilization and reintegration of children in Kaleya and other children associated with armed groups, and the ongoing efforts to prevent children from joining conflict areas across the border. ","Protection and Human Rights"
"On the sale of children, child prostitution and child pornography, Experts asked about data collection, institutional coordination and monitoring.  Issues of sex tourism, “confiage” system and assistance to victims of trafficking in persons as well as definition of offences under the Optional Protocol were discussed.  There must be greater clarity in the legislation on the prohibition of trafficking in children, particularly with regard to sanctions against traffickers; also, a distinction between sale of children and trafficking of children must be clearly made, which was particularly important given that Guinea bordered Mali, a country which did not abolish slavery.","Protection and Human Rights"
"Aly Diane, Permanent Representative of Guinea to the United Nations Office at Geneva, in closing remarks, reaffirmed the commitment to addressing the remaining concerns within set deadlines. ","Protection and Human Rights"
"In his closing statement, Mr. Konaté, assured the Experts that the their recommendations would be incorporated in the Children’s Code, the main guide on children protection for the Guinean authorities. ","Protection and Human Rights"
"In her closing remarks, Suzanne Aho Assouma, Committee Vice-Chair and Rapporteur for Guinea, urged Guinea to further harmonize the Children’s Code in particular with regards to the definition of trafficking in persons, build the capacity of various mechanisms and institutions and ensure that adequate resources were allocated so that the policies would be truly implemented.","Protection and Human Rights"

"Since the ratification of the Optional Protocol on the involvement of children in armed conflict in 2001, Guinea had taken steps to prohibit the recruitment of persons under the age of 18 and their direct involvement in armed conflict.  This was reflected in the enactment of a number of laws, including on the status of the police, the code of military justice, the status of military personnel and the status of refugees in Guinea.  In addition, the provisions of the Children's Code protected and afforded all possible guarantees to refugee children affected by armed conflict.  Mr. Konaté stressed that the provisions of the Optional Protocol had been taken into account both in the Constitution and in the Child Code Act. ","Protection and Human Rights"
"Guinea had set up a community identification system through the child protection system which operated both at the central and community level.  An independent National Human Rights Institution had been established, as well as the Constitutional Court and the Higher Judicial Council, while the military justice system had been reformed.  Dissemination efforts were being undertaken to raise awareness among all those working with children, including security and defence sector.  Numerous regional workshops had been organized in the past three years to promote children’s rights.  On the administrative level, the new law on judicial organization had brought about important changes.  In spite of the overall achievements, additional efforts were needed to bolster and include children’s concerns in all strategies and policies, concluded Mr. Konaté.","Protection and Human Rights"
"BENYAM MEZMUR, Committee Expert and Rapporteur for Guinea, asked the delegation to  clarify why it had taken so long after the ratification in 2001 to adopt the law incorporating the Optional Protocol in the domestic legislation in 2011, and also asked to which extent the law adopted prior to the ratification of the Optional Protocol was aligned with this instrument?","Protection and Human Rights"
"The Committee on the Protection of Human Rights was a national coordination body, remarked the Rapporteur and asked how the coordination was done and how effective it was?  Was this Committee also in charge of data collection?","Protection and Human Rights"

"SUZANNE AHO ASSOUMA, Committee Vice-Chair and Rapporteur for Guinea, asked what had been done to improve health infrastructure following the Ebola crisis and what budget had been allocated for this purpose? ","Protection and Human Rights"
"She pointed to the instability in the region and the conflicts which had broken out prior to the Ebola epidemics, and noted the vulnerability of the country to internal conflicts due to the political, economic or social demands.  The country had also experienced an influx of refugees since 1990 due to the instability in the region, notably in Cote d’Ivoire, and there were also returnees from neighbouring countries. ","Protection and Human Rights"
"The Rapporteur noted cases of recruitment of minors between 2000 and 2001 by armed groups in the context of the conflict in Liberia, and, welcoming the military law that prohibited the recruitment of persons under the age of 18 into the army, asked about the measures taken to ensure that children were not recruited in armed conflicts in those situations.","Protection and Human Rights"
"What birth registration mechanism was in place, particularly in rural areas?","Protection and Human Rights"
"The Rapporteur asked the delegation to confirm that no child had been recruited by armed groups and to inform about the curriculum and regulation of military schools as well as the oversight exercised by the Government.","Protection and Human Rights"
"With regard to child soldiers recruited by armed groups in the past and the programmes implemented for their reintegration with the help of international partners, were the social reintegration measures still ongoing?  What had been done to address the recruitment of young volunteers in 2009 in Kaleya, including the judicial investigations?  Did the children still live in the Kaleya camp and were the recruited children considered to be victims or perpetrators?","Protection and Human Rights"
"Ms. Aho Assouma expressed concern about children involved in political violence and asked whether any measures were being taken with regard to these children, including to implement programmes to combat youth violence.","Protection and Human Rights"
"Other Experts raised a question on the international cooperation, including with the United Nations agencies and also asked about the readiness of the Government to embark on raising the awareness on female genital mutilation and other issues not yet included in dissemination efforts?","Protection and Human Rights"
"The delegation was asked about the results of the work of the Commission on proliferation of small arms, and the training provided to the peacekeepers, considering that in 2007, the country had contributed 850 troops to the United Nations peacekeeping efforts; the extraterritorial application of the Optional Protocol; and the policy in place to address alcohol and drug abuse, and to identify and support street children.  Once children were intercepted at border crossings and returned to their parents, what measures were in place to ensure that they did not go back to conflict zones?","Protection and Human Rights"
"In response to questions raised about the institutional framework, a delegate said that the Guinean Committee on the protection of human rights comprised both governmental and civil society stakeholders and was operating under the Ministry of Social Affairs, Advancement of Women and Children’s Affairs.  It was tasked with monitoring the implementation of all conventions and protocols related to child protection, while children’s protection was mainstreamed across numerous sectors.","Protection and Human Rights"
"There were no other armed groups or rebel groups in Guinea, there was only the national army which meant that all recruitment happened according to the procedures in place.","Protection and Human Rights"
"On the subject of ""the Kaleya period"" of 2009, the delegation explained that this was an exceptional case in the history of the country, which should not be confused with the period 2000-2001, when the wars of Sierra Leone and Liberia had broken out and the rebel incursions into the south of the country had occurred.  In 2009, there had been a very ephemeral period of around six months during which young people had been recruited in Kaleya; today, it did not exist as a recruitment centre for young people, but it had become a training and retraining centre for the Guinean army, which provided qualification trainings and served to improve the capacity of military officials.  Those courses were opened only to individuals aged 18 and over.","Protection and Human Rights"
"The curriculum in military schools included international humanitarian law and human rights, and was harmonized with the general education system.  A national institution for combating corruption had been established within the Inspectorate General operating under the Ministry of Finance and Economy, while an anti-corruption law had recently been adopted by the National Assembly.","Protection and Human Rights"
"The delegation acknowledged the shortcomings in birth registration system, particularly in the “Guinée forestière” and said that, with the support of the European Union, a modern birth registration system was being developed; it would, among others, combat the falsification of identity documents, thus contributing to preventing the recruitment of minors.","Protection and Human Rights"
"The Ebola period had been a very painful one for the country.  It had put the health system to a grave test and had revealed all its shortcomings; bilateral cooperation during this period had enabled the strengthening of the health system.  Following the crisis, an integrated healthcare approach had been adopted, ranging from prevention to income generating activities.","Protection and Human Rights"
"The disease had orphaned 6,234 children and affected 130,000 in total; the care for the orphans had been set up in cooperation with social workers and non-governmental organizations, said a delegate, stressing that the Government wanted to avoid building orphanages and had opted for foster care and psycho-social support and counselling.  The support of the United Nations Children’s Fund had been instrumental in this process. ","Protection and Human Rights"
"As concerns the involvement of children in political parties, the delegation said that a number of initiatives had been put in place to reach out to political parties and explain that children should not be part of the political parties.  Municipal councils were also involved in outreach activities.","Protection and Human Rights"
"The international cooperation with the United Nation agencies did include dissemination of all aspects of the Optional Protocol on the involvement of children in armed conflicts, said the delegation and acknowledged the long time it took to incorporate the instrument.  During that decade, the country had invested significant efforts in raising the knowledge on the instrument and introducing measures enabling its implementation.","Protection and Human Rights"
"Concerning the cross-border movement and the problem of porous borders, including children going to conflict areas in Côte d’Ivoire, Sierra Leone and Liberia, the delegation stated that child protection forces were present and operating at the borders, intercepting such movements and bringing the children back to their families.","Protection and Human Rights"
"**Consideration of the Report under the Optional Protocol on the sale of children, child prostitution and child pornography**","Protection and Human Rights"
"Institutional set-up for the implementation of the Optional Protocol included the National Committee to Combat Trafficking in Persons and Children, the Inter-sectoral Committee on International Adoption and the Coalition of Non-Governmental Organizations to Combat Child Trafficking, the Office for the Protection of Gender, Children and Morals, as well as the unit within the armed forces and gendarmerie.  A new child policy had been set up, to be implemented through triennial action plans; the first plan 2017-2019 had already been adopted and presented to international development partners.  This new policy on children would focus on prevention and would continue to take care of children victims of abuse, abuse, exploitation, neglect and violence.  The Higher Council of Judiciary had been set up and it was addressing complaints against magistrates. ","Protection and Human Rights"
"The Government's policy was to create a protective environment for all children in the country, said Mr. Konaté, recognizing that this was a long-term process with many challenges, including poverty and illiteracy that affected a large part of the population; despite the efforts by the State and its partners to offer the Guinean child all the guarantees possible, many challenges remained.  In conclusion, Mr. Konaté said that the fight against the sale of children, the worst forms of child labour, trafficking in children and sexual violence against children were among the priorities of the Government of Guinea, and stressed the importance of the assistance of development partners in these efforts.","Protection and Human Rights"
"HATEM KOTRANE, Committee Expert and Rapporteur for Guinea, welcomed the important changes made since the ratification of the Optional Protocol, including the establishment of the Inter-sectoral Committee on International Adoption.  The question on centralized data collection was raised, where no progress had been noted.","Protection and Human Rights"
"Could the delegation provide more information on the scope of work of the Office for the Protection of Gender, Children and Morals?  The Rapporteur noted the one million dollars increase in budget allocation towards child policy and asked what specific allocations, as well as human resources, were envisaged for child protection.","Protection and Human Rights"
"Concerning the criminalization of offences under the Optional Protocol on the sale of children, the report stated that the provisions of the Code of Criminal Procedure had been consistent with the Protocol, so the delegation was asked to explain how such crimes were qualified.  Was child labour defined and punished as an instance of a sale of the child?","Protection and Human Rights"
"On the issue of impunity, what measures were in place to tackle impunity for all crimes under the Optional Protocol?  There were only two court rulings on trafficking in children charges, which was an extremely low rate.  Could the Optional Protocol on the sale of children be a legal basis for extradition? ","Protection and Human Rights"
"What efforts were being undertaken to disseminate the provisions among children, teachers, and professionals working with children. ","Protection and Human Rights"
"SUZANNE AHO ASSOUMA, Committee Vice-Chair and Rapporteur for Guinea, asked whether the child protection system in Guinea had sufficient resources particularly to reach all regions of the country, and also asked about the State’s involvement in the efforts of non-governmental organizations in the field of child protection, noting that some had to end their activities due to lack of resources.  Who were the mediators, how were they appointed and what was their real impact?","Protection and Human Rights"
"Regarding trafficking in children, Ms. Aho Assuma, noted that there was a movement of children crossing the border and that Guinea was a country of origin, transit and destination.  There must be greater clarity in the legislation on the prohibition of trafficking in children, particularly with regard to sanctions against traffickers, she said and asked whether the provisions were in place to punish parents who handed over their children for the purpose of trafficking.  The Rapporteur also inquired about the accompanying measures for trafficked children, including their reintegration and return.","Protection and Human Rights"
"On the issue of adoption, how was the Hague Convention on the Protection of Children and Co-operation in Respect of Intercountry Adoption being implemented?  Did the children leaving the country possess travel documents?  How frequently was trafficking disguised in the practice of ""confiding"" children, which involved the risk of abuse and exposure to sexual exploitation?","Protection and Human Rights"
"What were the causes of sex tourism and what was being done to address this problem, and also to address the problem of prostitution among minors?  What efforts were in place to raise awareness about pornography?","Protection and Human Rights"
"Other Committee Experts asked about the involvement of children in the reporting on the implementation of the Optional Protocol;  to what extent the National Policy on the Promotion and Protection of Children’s Rights and Well-Being covered the issues of concern to the Optional Protocol, and how the policy was funded; and whether the national human rights institution had the functions of the independent monitoring mechanism and could receive complaints from children.","Protection and Human Rights"
"The delegation was asked to explain whether children prostitutes were treated as victims and whether children exchanging pornographic materials could be prosecuted since the law did not make a distinction between adults and children.  Additional information was requested on child labour and on forced begging and on measures provided to victims of trafficking and children returning from border areas.  Guinea bordered Mali, a country which did not abolish slavery, thus it was very important to ensure that the distinction between trafficking and sale of children was enshrined in the law.","Protection and Human Rights"
"The Office for the Protection of Gender, Children and Morals had received public funding of approximately 28,000 dollars to investigate cases of trafficking and offer assistance to victims – how many cases of trafficking in persons had been prosecuted and what were the future plans for the Office?","Protection and Human Rights"
"Experts welcomed the criminalization of debt bondage in the 2016 Criminal Code and noted that judges were still not fully aware of those new provisions – what was being done to address this issue?","Protection and Human Rights"
"In response to the questions raised on data collection, the delegation said that very few studies had been conducted, but there were other forms of data gathering.  Planning and assessment unit for the protection of children existed and there were ongoing efforts to create a centralized database.  A project had been put in place by Terre des Hommes and the United Nations Children’s Funds to align variables in the child protection used by the National Institute for Statistics.","Protection and Human Rights"
"The delegation acknowledged difficulties in human resources and capacities which was why feminization and rejuvenation of public sector was underway, including through a European Union-supported programme which promoted employment of women and youth.","Protection and Human Rights"

"FAIRFIELD, Conn. (October 2, 2017)—The Trump Administration must take additional steps immediately to address the widespread devastation caused by Hurricane Maria in Puerto Rico and its impact on the health and well-being of Puerto Rican children and families, the international humanitarian organization Save the Children said today as President Trump prepares to visit Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands on Tuesday. ","Protection and Human Rights"
"""Too many of Puerto Rico’s 3.4 million people, which include nearly 700,000 children, remain stranded without access to power, shelter, clean water, or fuel nearly two weeks after Hurricane Maria struck the island on September 20,"" said Carolyn Miles, President & CEO of Save the Children. ""Much more action is needed and it is needed immediately. Children’s lives are at stake,"" she said.","Protection and Human Rights"
"Miles outlined four key steps that the Trump administration and Congress should take this week to help address the ongoing crisis: ","Protection and Human Rights"
"1. Expand the disaster declaration to include the entire island of Puerto Rico.","Protection and Human Rights"
"The White House’s original disaster declaration covered only a portion of Puerto Rico, but the entire island is devastated and needs the declaration so families in Puerto Rico can access federal funding for immediate relief to meet urgent, life-threatening needs.","Protection and Human Rights"
"2. Send a disaster funding request to Congress immediately.","Protection and Human Rights"
"The White House needs to send a request to Congress for disaster relief for Hurricane Maria immediately and not wait until mid-October as they have stated to the press. After Hurricane Harvey hit Texas, President Trump asked Congress for $8 billion in relief within six days. It has been more than a week since Hurricane Maria hit Puerto Rico, but we have yet to see any emergency requests to meet these urgent needs.","Protection and Human Rights"
"3. Move as fast as possible to get the resources to Puerto Rico that it so desperately needs.","Protection and Human Rights"
"We ask that the federal government deploy all relevant assets to Puerto Rico and provide stricken communities appropriate access so that Puerto Rican children and families can receive the services they need to survive in the aftermath of Hurricane Maria. The Trump Administration should work to ensure that additional military and other federal personnel arrive soon to address basic infrastructure needs such as clearing roads, repairing power lines, distributing supplies and other needs. ","Protection and Human Rights"
"4. Pay particular attention to the needs of children in preparedness, response and recovery.","Protection and Human Rights"
"Overall, the greatest current gap to meet the needs of children in disasters arise from inadequate funding. While the United States invests billions of dollars to support emergency preparedness and response, very often children’s needs are overlooked. In fact, of every $10 in federal emergency preparedness grants, less than 1 cent has gone toward activities targeting children’s safety. We need to dedicate more funding to emergency preparedness, response and recovery to lessen the gaps that remain and further support children.","Protection and Human Rights"
"Save the Children’s emergency response team is on the ground in Puerto Rico, working with partners to help children and their families recover and eventually rebuild. ","Protection and Human Rights"
"""Our immediate priority is to make sure children are safe, that they are with family members or friends and have access to food, water and shelter, including safe, supervised places for children to play,"" said Miles. ""While helping families meet their basic needs, we are also working with local partners to help get children back into school. Returning to a regular routine of going to school can have a tremendous, positive impact on children as they recover.""","Protection and Human Rights"
"Casey Harrity, the agency’s team leader in Puerto Rico, noted that team members have distributed much-needed materials to displaced children and their families, such as tarps, diapers, baby wipes and soap, as well as materials to create safe spaces for children in emergency shelters. ""There are still so many families and children that need help,"" Harrity said.","Protection and Human Rights"

"It reaffirmed the fundamental principle of refugee protection - an age-old value, now a universal, legally binding obligation.

"There have been important elements of progress this year - including through the application of the Comprehensive Refugee Response Framework, around which important momentum is building.","Protection and Human Rights"
"The Framework is now being applied in 11 Member States - Costa Rica, Djibouti, El Salvador, Ethiopia, Guatemala, Honduras, Mexico, Panama, Somalia, Uganda, and the United Republic of Tanzania, tailored to each context. Governments, including local authorities and a range of line ministries, are working closely with UNHCR and other partners. Important legislative and policy instruments have already been adopted in some of these countries - expanding access to education, jobs, and facilitating social and economic inclusion. ","Protection and Human Rights"
"The range of institutions and actors involved is growing. The engagement of the World Bank is particularly notable, and other development actors and private sector entities are also becoming involved. Important initiatives are also being pursued at the regional level - including through the work of IGAD in relation to Somali displacement, and in the north of Central America and Mexico, a regional framework to be adopted in Honduras next month.","Protection and Human Rights"
"This work is part of a broader effort to develop a global compact on refugees, which—as you know—we will propose in 2018. Thematic discussions are already under way, and formal consultations, based on a draft document, will take place next year.  ","Protection and Human Rights"
"We are also actively working with Louise’s team and IOM on the global compact for safe, orderly and regular migration. A strong compact will bring coherence and order to the management of international migration and pave the way for a future system of global migration governance. It will also have a positive impact on the human rights of both refugees and migrants. Refugees have - and must retain - a distinct status, because conflict and persecution mean they cannot go home. But the root causes of refugee flows and the triggers of irregular migration are often intertwined. And in mixed migratory movements, refugees and migrants often face overlapping risks. More safe and regular pathways for admission and the creation of a more tolerant and accepting environment, would bring important benefits for both groups.","Protection and Human Rights"
"We must not underestimate the task ahead. Despite the promise of the Declaration, the momentum that is building around comprehensive responses in a number of countries and regions, and the extraordinary generosity of many host countries, the last twelve months have also seen an erosion of protection and a shrinking of space for solutions in certain respects.","Protection and Human Rights"
"The seeds for change have been planted, but the shoots beginning to emerge need nourishment. The New York Declaration was an exceptional expression of political will at the highest level, but this must be sustained and made concrete - through political engagement, funding, technical support, and concrete acts in support of refugees and host countries - including in the major crises that are currently unfolding.

"Conflict in northeast Nigeria has caused a large-scale humanitarian crisis. Armed conflict has directly affected more than 14.8 million people, with an estimated 8.5 million people in need of urgent humanitarian assistance.1 Approximately 2 million people have been displaced, livelihoods have been lost, commercial markets and trade have been disrupted, host community resources are depleting, and large areas of Borno State remain inaccessible for humanitarian actors due to the volatile security situation.  ","Logistics and Telecommunications"
"Since late 2015, access to the affected populations in the conflict areas has gradually improved, enabling humanitarian organisations responding to the crisis to scale-up their operations, primarily to IDP and host communities in Maiduguri and the headquarters of many Local Government Authorities.  ","Logistics and Telecommunications"
"Insecurity, poor/damaged infrastructure and Increased humanitarian activity have placed significant demands on logistics capacity in the four affected states, with Borno State being most affected. Movement of humanitarian assistance into key operational areas remains limited, access for humanitarian staff is restricted, and some areas are inaccessible due to active hostilities. Given prevailing security conditions, most existing (or proposed) humanitarian aviation activities are supported by Nigerian Armed Forces (NAF) providing security.  ","Logistics and Telecommunications"
"In accessible parts of the northeast, humanitarian actors report no serious issues accessing necessary logistics services through the commercial sector in the majority of these states. However, in Borno State, the scale of humanitarian assistance is putting increasing strains on the logistics resources available (i.e. transport assets contracted out of Maiduguri can be of poor quality, prone to breakdown and/or with limited capacity to move on waterlogged roads).  ","Logistics and Telecommunications"
"The road network in the northeast is generally favourable for long haul trucking to state capitals with last mile delivery being made along primary or secondary roads which link the majority of locations hosting affected populations. However, 4x4 or 6x6 trucks are suggested for harder to reach areas hosting affected populations or with poor road conditions. During the rainy season, from July to September, the use of all-terrain vehicles to reach some communities may be required. During the rainy season in 2016 there were flood warnings in several Nigerian states, which necessitates the regular and careful monitoring of road conditions.  ","Logistics and Telecommunications"
"The volume of assistance and widespread damage to towns in Borno is also putting greater pressure on the existing warehouse capacity in Maiduguri and other field locations. Humanitarian actors also require additional capacities in customs clearance processes, warehouse management and the handling of specific relief items (i.e. dangerous goods).  ","Logistics and Telecommunications"
"There are also limited airstrip or aerodrome options in the northeast states. A number of field Landing Zones (LZs) have been established through the UNHAS Nigeria operations. Poor weather conditions, particularly during the Harmattan and the rainy season, insecurity and the limited supply of aviation fuel make conditions for air operations generally challenging.","Logistics and Telecommunications"
