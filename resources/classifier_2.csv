"Chair of the Advisory Group, Leni Stenseth and CERF Chief, Lisa Doughten welcomed the new members to the group: Jamie Isbister, Bruno van der Pluijm, Alexandra MacKenzie, Ricardo Toro Tassara, Rahel Asfaw, Claus Lindroos, Alison Milton, Mairo Mandara and Per Enarsson, and provided an introduction to CERF for new members, noting the essential role of the group in providing advice on the future of CERF.","Humanitarian Financing"
"Doughten then briefed the Advisory Group on the use and management of the fund during the period since its previous meeting in May 2017 and focused particularly on CERF’s response to the Rohingya refugee crises, emergencies related to the El Nino phenomenon, as well as CERF’s responses to Hurricane Irma and Maria in the Caribbean.","Humanitarian Financing"
"In his remarks, Assistant Secretary- General for Strategic Coordination in the Secretary-General’s Office, Fabrizio Hochschild, emphasized the essential role of CERF as a life-saving enabler in humanitarian emergency responses highlighted the importance of the Advisory Group appointed by the Secretary-General, articulating the Secretary-General’s support to CERF, especially the expanded target of $1 billion. _“CERF needs to grow because humanitarian needs are growing. It is one of the most effective tools to make a difference for people in need.”_ Hochschild concluded.","Humanitarian Financing"
"In a session with Resident Coordinator (RC) /Humanitarian Coordinators (HC) from Somalia and Barbados/OECS and members of the Inter-Agency Standing Committee, the RC/HCs provided examples of the use and impact of CERF funds and results achieved with CERF funds in Somalia and Barbados. RC/HC from Somalia, Peter de Clercq expressed appreciation for the $92 million received over the past two years and emphasized the positive effects of the complementarity between the use of CERF funds and funding from the Somalia Country-Based Pooled Fund. Stephen O’Malley, HC in Barbados/OECS acknowledged CERF’s added value to coordination and noted that _“receiving funding from CERF allowed for better coordination with UN agencies who were located away from each other.”_","Humanitarian Financing"
"In a session headed by Assistant Secretary-General Ursula Mueller, the Advisory Group expressed appreciation for presentations on initial findings from reviews of the added value of the fund for the response to crises caused by the El Nino phenomena. The final session of the meeting on the future of CERF focused on resource mobilization for CERF towards the General Assembly mandated increase of the fund to $1 billion. Mueller closed the session by calling upon Advisory Group members’ advocacy for CERF targeting state leaders and UN principals.","Humanitarian Financing"

"- In February 2018 four humanitarian response plans already announced in the GHO 2018 were officially launched: these were for **Burundi, Cameroon, Mali and Nigeria**. In addition, the 2018 Regional Refugee Response Plan for Burundi was published in February. Prior to the launch of the Ethiopia Humanitarian and Disaster Resilience Plan (HDRP) in March, and to ensure gaps in funding were being addressed while the HDRP was being finalized, a Humanitarian Prioritization Document for 2018 was released in February. This document indicated that $242.2 million is urgently required to address critical gaps for the coming six months. A plan highlighting the humanitarian situation induced by drought in **Mauritania** was also issued in February.  ","Humanitarian Financing"
"- As at 28 February 2018, UN-coordinated Humanitarian Response Plans (HRP) and the Syria 3RP Regional Refugee and Resilience Plan require $24.41 billion to meet the humanitarian needs of 128.8 million crisis-affected people in 26 countries.  ","Humanitarian Financing"

"- Securing full funding for the 2018 Yemen Humanitarian Response Plan (YHRP) is currently a top priority: after three years of conflict, conditions in **Yemen** are catastrophic. A record 22.2 million people need humanitarian assistance or protection – including 8.4 million who are severely food insecure. About 400,000 children under age 5 are severely malnourished and ten times likelier to die without treatment than healthy children. Some 2 million people remain displaced – 90% of whom fled their homes more than a year ago. Nearly 1.1 million suspected cases of cholera have been reported since April 2017 in what experts have called the world’s worst outbreak of the disease. An estimated 3 million women and girls in Yemen are at risk of gender-based violence.  ","Humanitarian Financing"
"- In February, the governments of Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates confirmed they would transfer $930 million by 31 March towards the 2018 YHRP.    ","Humanitarian Financing"
"Other donors have also stepped forward, with total pledges and funding to date amounting to about one-third of the entire appeal. On 3 April, the Secretary-General will convene a pledging conference in Geneva hosted by Sweden and Switzerland where all donors will have an opportunity to work together to provide the remaining resources needed for this response.  ","Humanitarian Financing"
"- Urgent funding is required to sustain and scale up life-saving assistance to vulnerable people in Mali. The 2018 HRP for **Mali** aims to provide life-saving aid for 1.56 million of the most vulnerable people among 4.1 million people exposed to deteriorating security conditions and a looming food and nutrition crisis; poor rains in 2017 have precipitated a lean season. Over 795,000 people require immediate food assistance, a figure expected to rise to 1.5 million people by June 2018. Over 460,000 people will be deprived of life-saving food assistance if funds are not forthcoming and if UNICEF doesn’t receive $15 million with which to treat severe acute malnutrition, 274,000 children will be placed at risk of death.

"The discussion begins with a short overview of the history of the debate on the linkages between organised crime and conflict with an African focus.

"The members of the Security Council reaffirmed that terrorism in all its forms and manifestations constitutes one of the most serious threats to international peace and security.  The members of the Security Council underlined the need to bring perpetrators, organizers, financiers and sponsors of these reprehensible acts of terrorism to justice.

"Since the adoption of its Global Strategy in 2016, European foreign and security policy has been in transition. In the Sahel, missions are being “regionalized,” the topic of migration management is gaining in importance, and there are significant structural changes in the works in Brussels. In addition, there is also a completely new instrument in the EU’s crisis management portfolio: the so-called “stabilization action” in Mali which is the first operationalization of Article 28 of the Treaty of Lisbon. As Tobias Pietz points out in his new [Policy Briefing](https://reliefweb.int/sites/reliefweb.int/files/resources/ZIF_Policy_Briefing_Pietz_GSVP_Sept_2017_EN.pdf), these changes hold both opportunities and risks for EU missions.","Peacekeeping and Peacebuilding"
"Conflicts and insecurity in the Niger Delta","Peacekeeping and Peacebuilding"
"For instance, in 2016, about four members of the Operation Crocodile Smile died when their boat capsized while they were on patrol. There has also been destruction of property worth millions of naira. Militancy was indeed taking its toll on the Nigerian economy with the country losing over N1.8 billion daily due to attacks on oil installations by militants (Okinbaloye 2016). The government has responded to the attacks by matching force with force, a step which analysts have criticised as not helping to achieve the goal of enduring peace in the region.","Peacekeeping and Peacebuilding"
"Amnesty represented an opportunity to stabilise the region for constructive conflict resolution negotiations. It was not the first time that an amnesty initiative had been put forward to resolve the violence in the region, but this time it was an offer backed with solid proposals for the necessary disarmament, demobilisation and reintegration of the region’s militants (Davis 2010). Despite this, however, the programme was not able to address regional violence, largely due to the lack of attention to the peculiar type of conflict in the Delta and the issues that gave rise to it. Thus, in order to fully appreciate the task of conflict resolution there, it is important to look at past attempts at conflict resolution in order to consider ideas for the future.","Peacekeeping and Peacebuilding"
"Theorising conflict in the Niger Delta region","Peacekeeping and Peacebuilding"
"Eco-violence, also known as environmental conflict, theory was developed by Homer-Dixon (1999:30) in his attempt to explain the causal relationship between natural resource endowment and the outbreak of violent conflict.","Peacekeeping and Peacebuilding"
"Decrease in the quality and quantity of renewable resources act singly or in various combinations to increase the scarcity, for certain population groups, of vegetation, farmland, water, forests etc. This scarcity of ecological resources can reduce economic productivity, both for the local groups experiencing the scarcity and for the larger regional and national economies. Consequently, the affected people may migrate or be expelled to new lands … while decreases in wealth can cause deprivation conflicts (Homer-Dixon 1999:30).","Peacekeeping and Peacebuilding"
"The central argument of the theory is that declining availability of renewable natural resources, which results in competition over scarce resources, engender violent conflict (Ajaero et al. 2015:471). This view was expressed by Annan (2006) when he stated that ‘environmental degradation in forms such as desertification, resource depletion and demographic pressure exacerbates tensions and instability …’. Michael (2001) also noted that:","Peacekeeping and Peacebuilding"
"Competition over the control of valuable oil supplies and pipeline routes has emerged as a particularly acute source of conflict in the 21st century. With the demand for oil growing and many older sources of supply (such as those in the United States, Mexico, and China) in decline, the pressure on remaining supplies, notably those in the Persian Gulf area, the Caspian Sea basin, South America, and Africa, is growing ever more intense.","Peacekeeping and Peacebuilding"
"This is seen from competition in Africa over the revenue generated from scarce natural resources which has led to violent conflict in Angola, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Rwanda, Sudan and Nigeria (Bhattacharyya 2015). The foregoing aptly describes the situation in the Niger Delta where oil exploration activities leading to environmental degradation such as shortage of farmlands, death of aquatic life, air and water pollution, oil poisoning causing respiratory ailments and destruction of mangrove forests, often without adequate compensation, have resulted in conflict. This was why the late environmentalist, Ken Saro-Wiwa, lamented that the people of the region faced extinction in what he described as an ecological war (Saro-Wiwa, cited in Na’Allah 1998).","Peacekeeping and Peacebuilding"
"Increasing frustration emanating from oil exploration has led to violent resistance which has culminated in conflict in the region between locals represented by militants and oil corporations operating in the region.","Peacekeeping and Peacebuilding"
"Efforts by the Nigerian government to address conflicts in the Niger Delta","Peacekeeping and Peacebuilding"
"Various efforts, beginning even before independence, have been made by the Federal Government to end the conflicts in the region. In 1957, the government established the Willink Commission to look into the problems of the minorities, and this Commission acknowledged the utter neglect of the region and, among other proposals, recommended the creation of the Niger Delta Development Board (NDDB). This Board could not achieve its aims for many reasons, one of which was the fact that its headquarters were located in Lagos, far from the problem area. With the creation of twelve states in 1967 and the establishment of the Niger Delta River Basin Authority (NDRBA), the NNDB became obsolete. In the second republic, a 1.5% Federation Account for the development of the Niger Delta region was set up for the oil producing areas, but because of the constraint of operating from its secretariat in Lagos it was not able to achieve its purpose.","Peacekeeping and Peacebuilding"
"Following criticisms of the military option, especially when it became obvious that the use of force by the JTF was aggravating rather than resolving the conflict, an amnesty programme was set up by the Federal Government on 25 May 2009 under the leadership of a former president, Umar Musa Yar’Adua. Amnesty was the Federal Government’s effort towards bringing enduring peace, security, stability and development to the region.","Peacekeeping and Peacebuilding"
"It involved granting of national and unconditional pardon to all armed militants in the Niger Delta region who in turn were to surrender their arms and ammunition, sign an undertaking not to return to the creeks and continue with the struggle and also sign the military re-unification forms. Amnesty followed the recommendations contained in the 2008 report by the Niger Delta Technical Committee (NDTC) initially established by the Federal Government, and chaired by MOSOP president Ledum Mitee, to assess initiatives taken in the region and provide for a comprehensive report and recommendations. The 45-member committee was inaugurated on 8 September 2008 to collate and review all past reports in the Niger Delta, appraise their recommendations and make other proposals that will help the Federal Government achieve sustainable development, peace, human and environmental security in the Niger Delta Region (Mitee 2009). The amnesty programme included a disarmament, demobilisation and reintegration process.","Peacekeeping and Peacebuilding"

"CNCM is a multilateral arrangement involving all parties in the conflict management process working together with parties to the conflict to find solutions to their problems. Negotiation is facilitated by a mediator acceptable to both parties. The mediator is a neutral person and a national of another country. The approach is voluntary, informal, improvised and adapted to the ad hoc situation; and because of the peculiarity and distinctiveness of each region, it is most effective when it occurs within regions (Crocker et al. 2011:51). Negotiations should preferably take place on neutral ground, for instance in a neighbouring country. In the case of the Niger Delta conflict, Ghana provides an appropriate location for negotiations.","Peacekeeping and Peacebuilding"
"The multilateral approach to conflict resolution has been found to be best suited for resolving natural resource conflicts in the 21st century (Mwanika 2010:7; Pynn 2011).

"It is usually undertaken by an ad-hoc arrangement or coalition that deals with specific security challenges and immediate conflict management needs in the situation concerned.","Peacekeeping and Peacebuilding"
"It is a democratic problem-solving approach that gives parties to a conflict equal opportunity to participate in finding common solutions to their problems. It involves communicating face-to-face with one another, dialoguing, and negotiating, thereby building trust. This is very important in the Niger Delta case as the issue of lack of trust on both sides has impeded the process of dialogue.","Peacekeeping and Peacebuilding"
"It is particularly effective when one or more key actors at the official or unofficial level are prepared to take the lead and mobilise partners who are willing to support a shared undertaking.","Peacekeeping and Peacebuilding"
"It comprises peacebuilding and conflict transformation processes from their inception to their conclusion, including the implementation of formal peace settlements which has been lacking in the peace processes in the Niger Delta so far.","Peacekeeping and Peacebuilding"
"Challenges of the collective non-violent approach","Peacekeeping and Peacebuilding"
"It needs a supportive environment as parties to the dispute must agree to the process and cooperate with the team otherwise it would not succeed. Because of the issue of sovereignty, a State may be reluctant to adopt an approach that may been seen as foreign interference in its domestic politics.","Peacekeeping and Peacebuilding"

"Armed conflicts in Africa have substantially declined from their peak in the early 1990s. The [12 ongoing conflicts](http://www.systemicpeace.org/warlist/warlist.htm) represent a 35 percent drop from two decades ago. This downward trend can be attributed to a variety of factors. One of these has been the greater willingness to deploy peacekeeping missions in Africa. Since 2000, more than 40 United Nations (UN), African Union (AU), and other UN–authorized missions have been deployed to the continent. This pattern reflects several developments:","Peacekeeping and Peacebuilding"

"African countries [contributed only 10,000 troops to UN operations in 2000](https://reliefweb.int/report/world/strengthening-african-peace-support-operations-nine-lessons-future-african-standby) when the AU was established. By 2017, some 18 African countries had contributed approximately 80,000 military, police, and civilian personnel to UN and AU missions, making Africa the largest contributor to global peace operations. Today, African forces represent 50 percent of all UN peacekeepers.","Peacekeeping and Peacebuilding"
"The AU has deployed [eight operations of its own](https://www.zedbooks.net/shop/book/the-future-of-african-peace-operations/) during this time, including to Burundi (AMIB), the Central African Republic (MISCA), the Comoros (AMISEC and MAES), Mali (AFISMA), Somalia (AMISOM), and Sudan (AMIS I and II). It has also deployed specialist task forces to combat the Lord’s Resistance Army in Central Africa and Boko Haram in Nigeria, Chad, and Cameroon.","Peacekeeping and Peacebuilding"
"This increase in AU peacekeeping is a departure from the operating norm of its predecessor, the Organization of African Unity (OAU). Under the OAU, the principle of “non-interference” prevailed with regard to political and humanitarian crises. Recognizing the devastating effects of prolonged conflicts on Africa’s stability and development, [the AU replaced the standard of non-interference with the principle of “non-indifference](http://www.achpr.org/instruments/au-constitutive-act/#4).” This principle asserts the right to intervene without host government consent in grave circumstances, including war crimes, crimes against humanity, and genocide.

"27 June 2018, Rome - Fall Armyworm keeps spreading to larger areas within countries in sub-Saharan Africa and becomes more destructive as it feeds on more crops and different parts of crops, increasingly growing an appetite for sorghum, in addition to maize. The pest could spread to Northern Africa, Southern Europe and the Near East, warned the United Nations' Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) today. The agency called for a massive scaling up of the Fall Armyworm campaign to involve more than 500 000 farmers in sub-Saharan Africa. ","Agriculture"
"""Fall Armyworm could leave 300 million people hungry in sub-Saharan Africa, having already infested maize and sorghum fields across 44 countries in an area of more than 22 million square kilometres - the combined area of the European Union, Australia and the United States,"" said Hans Dreyer, Director of FAO's Plant Production and Protection Division, on the sidelines of a resource partners' meeting in Rome.","Agriculture"
"To date, FAO has invested more than $9 million from its regular budget, and mobilized $12 million for its Fall Armyworm programmes.","Agriculture"
"""Despite significant contributions from resource partners and governments, there is still a significant financial gap. While we commend contributions made by a wide range of resource partners, including from those African countries affected by the pest, there is a need to urgently fill a critical gap of $23 million to allow FAO effectively support countries in addressing Fall Armyworm challenges in 2018,"" said Gustavo Gonzalez, FAO's Director of the Resource Mobilization Division.","Agriculture"
"The pest first appeared in Africa in 2016, in West Africa. By today, it has quickly spread across sub-Saharan Africa, leaving now only 10 countries (mostly in northern Africa) not infested.  ","Agriculture"
"Smallholders, representing almost all of the tens of millions of maize farmers in sub-Saharan Africa, are worst affected by Fall Armyworm, and any further damage inflicted by the pest would have drastic consequences on their lives.","Agriculture"
"For example, if 20 percent of their annual maize yield was lost to Fall Armyworm, it would result in a deficit of 16 million tonnes of maize, worth nearly $5 billion.","Agriculture"
"**Time for massive scaling up of Fall Armyworm campaign**","Agriculture"
"""In 2017, FAO and partners built a solid line of defense against the pest,"" said Allan Hruska, FAO's Principal Technical Coordinator on the Fall Armyworm response.","Agriculture"
"""We have developed tools and put measures into place to tackle Fall Armyworm - from training farmers and extension workers on how to apply ""local remedies"" such as collecting Fall Armyworm larvae killed by naturally occurring pathogens, making a mixture of these pathogens and applying them on the infested crops to kill the pest, to equipping them with mobile apps so they can recognize their new foe faster, and get immediate advice on how to manage it,"" he said.","Agriculture"
"""Farmers trained in Fall Armyworm management can now detect infestations earlier, are able to protect their crops better, and report less damage. The foundation is there. We just need to build on it - train over 500 000 farmers through 20 000 Farmers Field Schools across sub-Saharan Africa this year, support highly vulnerable countries where Fall Armyworm is widespread and capacity to manage it is low, develop resources in local languages, and get governments up to speed on sustainable Fall Armyworm measures, such as the use of bio-pesticides,"" added Hruska.","Agriculture"
"At the meeting, resource partners highlighted FAO's coordination role in tackling Fall Armyworm, and expressed support for FAO's integrated pest management (IPM) approach, which means managing Fall Armyworm in an effective, and economically and environmentally sustainable way.","Agriculture"
"FAO took immediate steps as soon as FAW was detected in Africa, including: bringing together experts to share knowledge and experiences on sustainable Fall Armyworm management; developing tools (farmers' manual, mobile apps, web-platform) to build better warning, monitoring and response mechanisms; and supporting countries to mitigate pest damage, develop action plans and policies, and train extension workers and farmers.","Agriculture"
"In October 2017, FAO launched a five-year, $87 million [Fall Armyworm programme](http://www.fao.org/food-chain-crisis/how-we-work/plant-protection/fallarmyworm/en/). FAO's Fall Armyworm response is supported by Belgium, Ireland, Japan and the United States of America.","Agriculture"
"More than 30 FAO-supported projects are rolled out across the continent to fight the pest. These include training 20 000 farmers and frontline extension workers to date as part of FAO's Farmer Field Schools to recognize and report Fall Armyworm infestations and use mechanical control, such as crushing of the pest by hand, and apply bio-pesticides (neem, tobacco plants) and natural enemies (ants) to destroy the pest.","Agriculture"
"FAO also provides technical and policy advice on pesticide management and is involved in monitoring the use of chemical insecticides.","Agriculture"
"FAO warns against the heavy use of pesticides, which can be harmful for people, their environment and in the longer run, and recommends the use of bio-pesticides, including those based on bacteria, virus, and fungus, which have been tested, developed, registered and used successfully in the Americas, where the pest has its origin.","Agriculture"
"These measures are in line with a sustainable, long-term management of Fall Armyworm as the pest cannot be eradicated, and African farmers need to learn to manage it with without jeopardising their health and their environment.","Agriculture"
"FAO also developed a framework for partnership so that organisations joining the fight against Fall Armyworm can follow guidelines on sustainable management of the pest when developing their projects and programmes.","Agriculture"
"**Dry spell continues across most of Somalia in mid-June**","Agriculture"
"According to satellite-derived rainfall estimates (RFE2), no precipitation was recorded in most regions of Somalia during the June 11-20 period, except for small areas in the Northwest and South (Figure 1). Ground information confirmed that localized areas of Northwestern Agropastoral, West Golis Pastoral, and Hawd Pastoral livelihood zones in Awdal, Woqooyi Galbeed, and Sanaag regions received light to moderate rains. A similar pattern of localized rainfall was reported in most livelihood zones in Lower Juba, Middle Juba, and Bay regions. In general, little to no precipitation in mid-June is climatologically average for most of the country; however, a few localized pockets in the northwestern, central, and southern regions experienced deficits 10-50 mm below the 2005-2009 short-term mean (Figure 2). No new flooding events were reported during the middle period of June.","Agriculture"
"In the **Northwest**, localized light to moderate rains were reported in parts of Northwestern Agropastoral and Hawd Pastoral livelihood zones in Woqooyi Galbeed and localized areas of West Golis Pastoral livelihood zone in Awdal, Woqooyi Galbeed, and Sanaag regions. Little to no rainfall was reported in the rest of Awdal, Togdheer, Sool, and Sanaag regions.","Agriculture"
"In the **Northeast**, no rainfall was reported across the pastoral livelihood zones of Bari, Nugaal, and northern Mudug. Little or no precipitation has been reported in these regions over the past month. However, dry conditions are climatologically typical in the Northeast at this time of year, and access to water and pasture is average in most areas.","Agriculture"
"In the **central regions**, no rainfall was reported across the pastoral or agropastoral livelihood zones, leading to localized rainfall deficits. Although the dry spell is beginning to negatively impact rangeland resources, access to pasture and water remains favorable at this time.","Agriculture"
"In the **South**, no rainfall was recorded in Hiiraan, Bakool, and Gedo regions, similar to the last 10-day period. Light showers were reported in most livelihood zones of Bay and Middle Juba, as well as Southern Agropastoral livelihood zone in Lower Shabelle. In contrast, moderate rainfall of average intensity and distribution was reported across the livelihood zones of Lower Juba. Rain gauge stations recorded 25 mm in Sakow (Middle Juba), 7.5 mm in Baidoa (Bay), and 0 mm in Afgoye (Lower Shabelle), Hudur (Bakool), and Beledweyn (Hiiraan).

"High-quality agricultural index insurance has shown promise in promoting resilience among small-scale farmers who face a constant risk of drought and other weather-related shocks. However, despite decades of investments this tool has yet to achieve its broadest impact in part because of low-quality contracts that don’t reliably pay farmers for losses and that sometimes pay when there are none.","Agriculture"
"USAID is partnering with the University of California, Davis to take on this challenge by establishing the world’s first agricultural index insurance quality certification in Kenya. The $1.7 million initiative, “Innovations to Improve the Quality and Uptake of Agricultural Index Insurance in East Africa,” will help ensure that products for small-scale farmers across East Africa truly can promote long-term resilience.","Agriculture"
"“This initiative to establish a certification for index insurance quality could have a ripple effect that creates incentives for insurance companies to create higher quality contracts,” said Michael Carter, the initiative’s lead and a professor of agricultural and resource economics at UC Davis. “This development could significantly improve small-scale farmers’ opportunities for long-term resilience despite increasing risks of weather-related catastrophes.”","Agriculture"
"**The Promise of Agricultural Index Insurance and the Problem of Low Quality**","Agriculture"
"Poor farmers in emerging economies whose livelihoods depend on the food they can grow often also face a high risk of losing crops to drought or some other weather-related catastrophe. This risk of losing everything in a bad year keeps them from investing in improved seeds or fertilizer despite the potential gains.","Agriculture"
"Agricultural index insurance is a tool to stop this cycle of persistent poverty. Research has shown that in good years, index insurance encourages farmers to invest more for higher incomes. In bad years, high-quality agricultural index insurance provides nearly the same protection as conventional insurance except without the high costs of verifying each individual claim.","Agriculture"
"Low-quality index insurance remains a major barrier to scaling these kinds of impacts despite decades of support from The World Bank, USAID, DIFD, GIZ, international NGOs and national governments, stunting the technology’s potential worldwide. In fact, low-quality contracts put households who are already vulnerable at greater risk.","Agriculture"
"“The problem is when an index insurance contract is of such low quality that it systematically fails to pay out as it should,” said Carter. “This kind of contract is more likely to leave a farmer worse off for having bought it than it is to help them to achieve long-term stability and resilience.”","Agriculture"
"**Establishing Index Insurance Quality Certification for East Africa**","Agriculture"
"For this new USAID initiative, UC Davis and NASA will partner with the Regional Center for Mapping of Resources for Development (RCMRD) to establish the world’s first board for Quality Index Insurance Certification (QUIIC) and a technical lab to refine and measure index insurance quality. RCMRD is a Nairobi-based organization providing geo-information to 20 national governments in Africa and will lead the QUIIC board and technical lab by 2022.","Agriculture"
"This initiative will expand on existing collaborations and build new ones. RCMRD already partners with the NASA Applied Sciences Team as part of the NASA/USAID SERVIR network that seeks to improve environmental decision-making among developing nations around the world. The UC Davis team will add expertise in using remote sensing to predict crop losses and in building high-quality index insurance contracts.","Agriculture"
"“What’s so exciting is that this field of remote sensing has been going on for 40 years almost, and it’s really booming right now because of new sensors and satellites being sent out as we speak,” said Robert Hijmans, a professor of environmental science and policy at UC Davis and a collaborator on the project. Hijmans leads the Ecology, Geography, and Agriculture lab at UC Davis as well as the Geospatial and Farming Systems Research Consortium for the Feed the Future Innovation Lab for Sustainable Intensification at Kansas State University.  ","Agriculture"
"Carter led the development of the Feed the Future AMA Innovation Lab’s Minimum Quality Standard (MQS) for agricultural index insurance. MQS is a measure that compares the value of an agricultural index insurance contract against the value of having no insurance or an equivalent cash transfer. MQS will be the starting point for the quality measure adopted by the QUIIC board.","Agriculture"
"“This uncertainty of quality is the same with improved seeds, except that seeds are certified with national standards for germination rates and yields,” said Carter. “Index insurance is a complex financial instrument but there are no similar certifications or standards for quality so farmers know a contract won’t fail them in their time of need.”","Agriculture"
"The USAID initiative will also include an opportunity to test QUIIC with a separate intervention in Uganda designed to increase uptake for high-quality agricultural index insurance. The team will collaborate with Uganda insurance companies to create a fine-tuned QUIIC-certified index insurance contract, which will be distributed through village saving groups.","Agriculture"
"This “VISA” model of distribution for index insurance will be randomized to measure its impact on household well-being. It will leverage the expertise of the Grameen Foundation, an international NGO, in community-based savings groups.","Agriculture"
"“This USAID initiative is a valuable opportunity to not only establish an Africa-based quality certification for index insurance but also to test its impact at the same time,” said Carter. “This forward-thinking approach to promoting resilience should pay out dividends to small-scale farmers worldwide.""","Agriculture"

"LAIKIPIA, Kenya, March 7 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - At Sweet Waters, a village in central Kenya, Veronicah Nyambura stands under the hot sun between two fields. One is full of lush plants - but the other has crops so wilted that their leaves have curled up.","Agriculture"
"The green land is planted with tea tree, an Australian native that thrives in this semi-arid part of Kenya. Opposite is a field of maize, which suffers in years of poor rains and high temperatures.","Agriculture"
"""Maize is very disappointing. You plant but you're never sure whether you'll harvest anything,"" said Nyambura, who has planted a quarter-acre of tea trees.","Agriculture"
"The 65-year-old said she harvests 900 kg of tea tree branches every six months from that bit of land. When it was planted to maize, she got about 270 kg of grain every nine months, she said.","Agriculture"
"Many farmers in this part of Laikipia County – like farmers in many parts of the world - cannot afford to buy seeds for alternative crops better suited to drought, so keep planting maize.","Agriculture"
"But Nyambura and about 800 other small-scale farmers were sold tea tree seedlings on credit by a company called Earthoil that also guaranteed to buy their harvest. Each seedling cost 3.5 Kenyan shillings, or about 3 cents.","Agriculture"
"Earthoil, which buys the branches for between 17 Kenyan shillings ($0.17) and 19 Kenyan shillings ($0.19) a kilogram, extracts the tea tree oil at its local distillery and exports it to British skin-care company, The Body Shop.","Agriculture"
"To meet the demands of buyers, Martin Thogoto Mwambia, 68, uses mulch - not chemical fertilisers or pesticides - on his 1.75-acre tea tree farm in Ngarariga village, in neighbouring Nyeri county.","Agriculture"
"""I am mulching them with cowdung and dried leftovers of tea tree,"" he said with a smile while rubbing the dirt off his hands.","Agriculture"
"The farmer said he has reaped a fortune from the crop, which means he does not have to spend his old age working in menial jobs.","Agriculture"
"""Handling 50,000 Kenyan shillings ($490) and sometimes 100,000 Kenyan shillings ($990) is a miracle to me. Tea tree has given me that privilege,"" said Mwambia, who worked as a guard in a local firm before he began growing tea trees.","Agriculture"
"Prior to tea tree he grew maize - but even in good years he earned far less, he said.","Agriculture"
"""Sometimes when the drought is at its worst I would harvest a tin (a kilogramme) or two,"" said Mwambia who is now harvesting an average of 10,000 kgs of tea tree branches annually from his farm.","Agriculture"
"The proceeds have enabled him to buy two dairy cows, get connected to electricity and buy a television set.","Agriculture"
"""Life is better for us now. I am happy,"" said his wife, Jane Gathigia.","Agriculture"
"The drought-tolerant tea trees come with the advantage of a ready market, the farmers said.","Agriculture"
"""Marketing maize is a headache. The prices fluctuate from time to time and farmers end up making losses,"" said Alice Wanja, 42, at her quarter-acre tea tree farm at Sweet Waters, about 1.5 km from Nyambura's home.","Agriculture"
"""There is nothing like that with tea tree. The buyer is already at the waiting end and the buying price is good,"" she said.","Agriculture"
"The Laikipia County project came about through a grant from the Global Environment Facility (GEF), administered by the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) and implemented by a local charity, Kenya Organic Agriculture Network (KOAN), which partnered with Earthoil.","Agriculture"
"Although projects of this kind guarantee farmers a reliable buyer, they do not necessarily offer security in the longterm since the buyer may go out of business or move elsewhere, warned Tom Nyamache, professor of economics at Turkana University College.","Agriculture"
"On the flip side, the buyer is also at risk of closing shop if the farmers' productivity falls or fails completely, he said.","Agriculture"
"It is important that farmers plant an alternative crop that also can thrive in the changed climate conditions to serve as a fallback should their tea tree ventures fail, he said.","Agriculture"
"Earthoil's project manager, Martin Wainaina, said there is such a big demand for tea tree oil that they are making aggressive plans to expand production.","Agriculture"
"The Body Shop wants 30 tonnes of oil from the firm each year, but Earthoil can currently only supply 8 tonnes, he said.","Agriculture"
"Expanding the pool of farmers is a challenge. The plants have to be grown near the distillery, as tea tree branches are bulky and difficult to transport, he said.","Agriculture"
"The tea tree thrives in the volcanic soil and high altitudes in this region near Mount Kenya, Wainaina said.","Agriculture"
"Expanding production to other parts of Kenya with similar arid and semi-arid climates will only be possible through research and investment in more tea tree processing, analysts say.","Agriculture"

","Agriculture"
"- Rainfall has also been persistently heavy over the past month in western and central Yemen, Uganda, and western Kenya, and the start of season A has been reported in Burundi and Rwanda. Field reports indicate heavy rainfall has led to flooding and mudslides in parts of eastern Uganda.  ","Agriculture"
"- During the next two weeks, much of western and central Ethiopia, southern Sudan, South Sudan, and Uganda are expected to continue receiving widespread moderate to very heavy rainfall. Pastoral and agropastoral areas of the Horn of Africa affected by drought in 2016 and 2017 are expected to remain mostly dry, though rainfall is for parts of northern Somalia.","Agriculture"
"Rainfall was above average during September over much of Sudan, northeastern South Sudan, and the western and central highlands of Ethiopia, which has generally been the case since the start of the season in June. Cumulative seasonal rainfall to date has been well above average in many of these areas (Figure 1) has resulted in the severe flooding over parts of eastern Sudan lowlands, including along the Blue Nile and Atbara river basins.","Agriculture"
"Rainfall has also been persistently heavy over the past month in western and central Yemen, Uganda, and western Kenya. There are also recent field reports of floods and mudslides over Mt. Elgon region in eastern Uganda, more specifically in Nyundo, Bukimbiri, Harugale, Masaba, and Bumayoka districts where there were reports of property damage, human and livestock displacements in the past weeks. However, over the past month, rainfall has been below average (-25 to -100 mm) over some localized areas of western Karamoja regions and southern Uganda.","Agriculture"
"The timely to early onset of season A rains (late September to December) in Rwanda, Burundi and parts of eastern DRC are also likely to gradual improve the current rangeland resources and mark the crop planting season. A few areas over northern and southern Somalia also experienced unseasonal light to moderate rains during this time.","Agriculture"
"The Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) indicates near to slightly above average vegetation conditions in much of western Ethiopia, South Sudan, western Kenya and Karamoja in Uganda (Figure 2). Persistent cloud cover has remained and limited comprehensive monitoring of the current vegetation conditions in parts of western Ethiopia, southern Sudan and northeastern South Sudan. Nevertheless, cropping conditions in many high-producing rainfed agricultural areas of Sudan appear to be average tending to above average, following very favorable performance of main season rainfall. However, NDVI suggests there are significant areas of Kassala, northern Gadaref, and southern North Darfur where seasonal vegetation growth was delayed and vegetation conditions remain below average.","Agriculture"
"Field reports further suggest cropping, particularly in Kassala and northern Gadaref, was significantly impacted by early season dry spells and that area planted in those areas was below normal. Moreover, excessive and persistent rainfall over eastern Sudan has caused crop damage and loss due to waterlogging and reported flash floods in Sennar and surrounding states. In Ethiopia, although seasonal rainfall has been average or above average in most western areas, crops planted during the Belg but harvested during the Meher are likely to suffer from reduced yields, particularly in SNNPR, where a late start of season reduced the length of the growing season for long-cycle crops. Cropping prospects are also poorer than usual in western Kenya due to the erratic but early onset of its seasonal rains in late Feb/early March, coupled with the extensive Fall Armyworm (FAW) infestation of the young maize crop in Uasin-Gishu and Trans-Nzoia counties.","Agriculture"
"Meanwhile, much of the Horn of Africa has remained seasonally dry with very low levels of pasture and water following consecutive seasons of drought, particularly in southeastern Ethiopia, most of Somalia, and northern Kenya. Recent off-season rainfall in western areas of Kenya have led to significantly improved water and forage availability.","Agriculture"
"The following is a country-by-country update on recent seasonal progress to date:","Agriculture"
"- In Sudan, main season rainfall has continued to be average tending to above average over most parts of Sudan during the month of September, which has been mostly favorable for crop production in most high-producing areas. Field reports suggest extensive flooding has occurred, including in eastern and western Sudan, which has resulted in damage to crops and property. Presently, five of the worst flood affected areas in Sudan are El Fashir, Nyala, Delgo, Singa, Halafaya El Gezira, and Atbara.  ","Agriculture"
"- In Ethiopia, Kiremt rainfall has been largely average or above average, since the start of the cropping season in early June and is forecast to continue into the end of September. However, Belg crops harvested in the Meher were also affected by an erratic start of season and could suffer from reduced yields. The infestation FAW on an estimated 22 percent of the maize area planted is likely to reduce maize production in some areas.  ","Agriculture"
"- In Kenya, unseasonal rains between July and mid-September in northwestern counties of Turkana, West Pokot, Baringo, and northwestern portions of Marsabit have been generally beneficial in replenishment of rangeland resources and led to improvements in livestock body conditions. However, due to the prolonged drought in other pastoral areas over northeastern and southern regions of Kenya, rangeland conditions have continued to deteriorate in the past month.  ","Agriculture"
"- In Somalia, conditions remain drier than normal. However, there is an increased likelihood for moderate to heavy rains in the coming two weeks over northern Somalia as indicated in GFS rainfall forecasts.  ","Agriculture"
"- In Uganda, rainfall in Karamoja in September was above average tending to average and total cumulative rainfall for the June – September season is expected to be above average. The September to November second rainy season in bimodal regions started earlier than usual in many areas and rainfall totals have been above average since August.  ","Agriculture"
"- In South Sudan, the first season harvest is ongoing in Greater Equatoria and the green harvest is available in Greater Bahr el Ghazal and Greater Upper Nile. Despite average to above-average seasonal rainfall, production is expected to be well below average as a result of widespread civil insecurity. Crop damage due to Fall Army Worm (FAW) is also likely to have adverse impacts in regions worst affected by the pest, especially in Torit, Magwi, Budi, Juba, and Aweil.  ","Agriculture"
"- In Yemen, the second season (July to September) rainfall performance has been generally above average over its southwestern highlands and into parts of central and eastern pastoral areas. However, conflict continues to disrupt agricultural activities in worst-affected areas.  ","Agriculture"
"- In DRC, seasonal rainfall during the month of September below average (-50 to -100mm) over northeastern, east-central and southeastern areas bordering Uganda, Rwanda, and Burundi.  ","Agriculture"
"- In Burundi and Rwanda, the September to December 2017 rainy season has begun, and eastern areas of Rwanda have received above-average rainfall. Land preparation efforts for Season A are underway in both countries.  ","Agriculture"

She moves from one house to another, visiting each poultry farmer. All of them are alerted a day in advance so that they don’t release their free-range chickens in the morning.","Agriculture"
"The first farmer she visited when an IPS reporter accompanied her on her rounds was Maxwell Panganani, who owns 30 chickens. The whole flock was given the vaccine, which protects poultry from the deadly Newcastle Disease (ND) and costs four cents per chicken. This means Katengeza collected 1.24 dollars from this farmer.","Agriculture"
"She moved on to other households: Makalani Kumapeni, whose 51 chickens were given the vaccine; Chipiliro Kanamwali with 11 chickens; Peter Lumbwe with 24 chickens; Zeze Lumbwe with 14 chickens, Frank Thamisoni with 12 chickens and Samuel Asipolo, who just owns one.","Agriculture"
"Raised by 80 percent of local farmers, poultry is the greatest contribution to household food and nutritional security of all livestock species in Malawi. Farmers use chickens during weddings, funerals and other rituals, and for sale or as gifts. They are also bartered for other products.","Agriculture"
"However, despite the important role that chickens play in supporting households in rural areas, there is a major constraint to the expansion and increased productivity of poultry – the frequent devastation of flocks, up to 90 percent, according to the Department of Animal Health and Livestock Development (DAHLD). This damage is caused by ND, which strikes during the hot, dry months of August through to November annually.","Agriculture"
"The virus presents primarily as an acute respiratory illness, and is one of the most serious of all avian diseases. It is also transmissible to humans.","Agriculture"
"“We were first trained as farmer field facilitators in 2014 under a CARE Malawi programme. Later CARE linked us with Inter Aide, a French organization that provided us training in the procedures of how to be a community vaccinator,” says Katengeza, who is also village head woman of Chizinga in Traditional Authority Kalumbu, Lilongwe district.","Agriculture"
"According to Katengeza, the knowledge and procedures learnt during vaccine administration have been of great benefit to her as a farmer. As a result of the training, her chickens no longer die of ND. And as a ripple effect, she has also managed to help her fellow farmers to overcome the disease.","Agriculture"
"“I now have 10 goats, harvested 70 50-kg bags of maize this year, moulded bricks and built a good house. I am also able to pay school fees for my kids. As a family, we have sustained access to proteins as body-building foods from chickens once slaughtered,” says Katengeza.","Agriculture"
"She said CARE and Inter Aide have changed her life and that of other farmers.","Agriculture"
"Another farmer, Eveless Makalani, with a flock of 51 birds, has worked with community vaccinators for some time. She learned about them during the farmer extension meetings they conduct in the village.","Agriculture"
"“My family gets help from these chickens, especially during funerals and weddings, but also in the event of problems. We sell some of them as they are in high demand on the market, unlike hybrids.”","Agriculture"
"Malakani adds that the money earned from selling one chicken pays for the vaccination of over 50 chickens from ND – making it a viable business.","Agriculture"
"Yolomosi Tifere, a male community vaccinator who serves farmers in the Nathenje area, said the project should be expanded to include other health supports.","Agriculture"
"“This vaccine is for ND fine and good. However, we also need other drugs to address bacteria, cough, intestinal worms so that these problems are also taken care of,” Tifere said in an interview during the field visit.","Agriculture"
"Graça Archer, Programme Officer for Inter Aide Newcastle Disease Control Programme, said each ND campaign is systematic and runs for four months.","Agriculture"
"“During the first month, community vaccinators go house to house to do poultry registration, like how many chickens to vaccinate, how many vials are needed. The second month is for the actual vaccination of the chickens and the fourth month is for review of the success and challenges.” Archer explained in an interview.","Agriculture"
"The peak of the campaign takes place in July because the risk of an outbreak is high. This is when farmers have more money and exchange more chickens and there is a greater probability for them to become infected with ND.","Agriculture"
"“There is more acceptance from the farmers in July than the two other campaigns. For instance, last year we vaccinated 590,800 chickens,” says Archer, who expressed concerns about the erratic supply of the drug from CVL.","Agriculture"
"In order to ensure sustainability of the programme, NCVA was formed to strengthen local participation in the fight against ND. Meanwhile, the Global Alliance for Livestock Veterinary Medicine is working in partnership with Inter Aide to improve the nutrition and livelihoods of smallholder livestock producers, and enhance family farm productivity and resilience in an increasingly changing climate.","Agriculture"
"“The I-2 vaccine is thermal tolerant demand driven, people see the benefit of vaccinating chickens so there is exponential growth for the vaccine need. However, production is not managed as an enterprise due to shortage of financing of the drug, hence its erratic availability,” Archer explained.","Agriculture"
"Gilson Njunga, Officer in Charge at the CVL, says they produce 3,000 bottles of the vaccine per month which translates to about a million dosages administered to chickens, as each bottle accommodates 300 chickens.","Agriculture"
"“Production of the vaccine vial is at 3,000 bottles monthly because we produce the vaccine within a diagnostic laboratory and not an independent vaccine lab. As such, the production process has to pass through quality control before being certified for use by farmers to ensure they are not contaminated,” Njunga told IPS.","Agriculture"
"Meanwhile, as a further step towards attaining food and nutritional security, the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations and the Malawi Government agreed on a Country Programme Framework estimated at 24.3 million dollars. The rationale for the proposed CPF priority areas is derived from the analysis and the enabling environment for Food and Nutrition Security and Sustainable Agriculture.","Agriculture"

"In Uganda, maize is the highly cultivated crop, with 86% of the country’s households engaged in its growing, according to Dr Godfrey Asea, the director    National Crops Resources Research Institute (NaCRRI).","Agriculture"
"Asea made the call while addressing journalists who were undergoing training in agricultural biotechnology at NaCRRI offices in Namulonge in Wakiso district.","Agriculture"
"According to him Uganda produces about four metric tonnes of maize annually, but last year, about 30% of it was lost by a sour mixture of drought and armyworm, among other challenges.","Agriculture"
"There was also food shortage as a result of prolonged drought. ","Agriculture"
"Asea explained that there are several drought-tolerant species in the market and it is important that farmers embrace them. ","Agriculture"
"He expressed concern about limited information on such varieties, an issue that accounts for the only 30% adoption of the varieties. ","Agriculture"
"The research on varieties was done through a public-private partnership of Water Efficient Maize for Africa (WEMA) in five African countries of Uganda, Kenya, Tanzania, Mozambique and South Africa. ","Agriculture"
"According to media reports, over 10.9 million Ugandans experienced acute food insecurity in February 2017. The food insecurity was experienced in West Nile, parts of Kigezi, Teso and  Yumbe.","Agriculture"
"“Only a resilient variety could withstand this ‘cocktail’ of constraints. However, most famers still rely on rainfall for production.

"Northern parts of the region received good rainfall since October, and most areas had normal to above normal cumulative rainfall totals as of mid-December 2017 (Figure 1, green colours). Areas where above normal rains were received include the north-eastern half of Angola, much of DRC, north Zambia, northern Mozambique, northern and central Madagascar, and much of Tanzania.  ","Agriculture"
"In contrast, most places in the southern half of the region received below average rainfall since October 2017 (yellow and brown colours, Figure 1). These areas include southern Angola, most of Botswana and Namibia, south-western and central South Africa, Lesotho, southern Mozambique, southern Zambia, Zimbabwe, and south-western Madagascar. Some bimodal areas in the north-eastern parts of Tanzania also received well below average rainfall. November was particularly dry in many of these areas, while southern Mozambique, southern Zambia, and Zimbabwe received low rainfall in the first half of December. ","Agriculture"
"Despite the low rainfall in the southern half of the region, most areas had experienced an onset of rains by early December (Figure 2). In a few areas where the seasonal rains have not yet started, the delay in onset ranges from approximately 20 to 30 days (grey colours, Figure 2).  ","Agriculture"
"Areas affected include south-western Angola, parts of southern and central Mozambique, parts of northern Namibia, and southern South Africa. A prolonged delay in the onset of rains can negatively affect crop yields by reducing the number of days available for crop development, and crops can fail to reach maturity before the end of the growing season. Most areas where the season has already started experienced a timely onset of rains, except for parts of Lesotho, South Africa, DRC and Zimbabwe, where the onset was delayed by as much as 30 to 40 days. Due to the generally timely onset, farmers in many areas have started planting, with reports of crops being in the initial to early vegetative stage in some areas.  ","Agriculture"
"However, in some of the areas that received below average rainfall in November through early December, particularly southern Mozambique, southern Zambia and Zimbabwe, crops have been affected by insufficient moisture, with reports that some farmers have not yet planted. In cases where planting has already occurred in the above-mentioned areas, some crops are reported to be experiencing moisture stress due to the prevailing dry conditions.  ","Agriculture"
"As a result of the dry spell, vegetation conditions have deteriorated in many areas. The satellite vegetation index image (Figure 3) shows that many parts of the region had below average vegetation conditions (yellow and brown colours, Figure 3) by the first dekad of December.  ","Agriculture"
"Reports from Namibia indicate that the poor rainfall has led to a deterioration of grazing conditions in several parts of the country. As a consequence, livestock are reported to be in poor to fair body condition in parts of the country, although livestock in other areas were reported to be in fair to good condition.  ","Agriculture"
"SADC Climate Services Centre, in conjunction with national meteorological agencies from the region, in December issued an updated seasonal rainfall forecast for the Jan-to-Mar, Feb-to-Apr, and Mar-to-May 2017 periods for the SADC region. The forecast update maintained a higher likelihood for normal rainfall in all parts of the region, with a potential tendency for above normal rainfall in most areas. Among countries that updated their forecasts for January to March, Botswana and Zimbabwe reduced their expectations for above normal rainfall. Botswana’s revised forecast predicts normal to above normal rainfall in most areas except for eastern Botswana where normal rainfall is expected, while Zimbabwe expects normal rainfall throughout the country for the January-March period. Users are advised to contact their respective national meteorological agencies for forecast updates and interpretation.  ","Agriculture"
"Given the poor rains that have been received in the southern half of the region to date, well distributed rains will be required for the remainder of the season in order to avert negative climatic impacts on agriculture. A continuation of good rains in the northern half as forecast will raise the potential for good production in those areas. The latest forecasts, which are generally presenting reduced chances for above normal rainfall in some southern parts of the region, imply the need for farming methods that promote conservation of soil moisture and reduce the risk of severe crop moisture stress due to dry spells that can potentially occur, especially in the climatologically drier areas. These methods include mulching and minimum tillage, amongst others.  ","Agriculture"
"Interventions to promote the availability of functional irrigation equipment where possible are also important, as they can reduce the potential impact of dry spells in areas where they normally occur.  ","Agriculture"

"[Fall Armyworm](http://www.fao.org/food-chain-crisis/how-we-work/plant-protection/fallarmyworm/en/) is an insect native to tropical and sub-tropical America. It arrived in Africa in early 2016, and has since spread across all of Sub-Saharan Africa, with North Africa now also at risk. It can feed on over 80 crops, but it is affecting most strongly smallholder maize farmers with no experience of the pest, and few resources to manage it. If left unchecked, FAW could significantly impact the primary food source of more than 200 million people in Sub-Saharan Africa, and lead to annual economic losses of up to $4.8 billion from maize production alone.","Agriculture"
"[Peste des petits ruminants](http://www.fao.org/ppr/en/) is a fast-spreading viral disease that affects and kills up to 90 percent of the infected small ruminants (sheep and goats). It was first reported in Ivory Coast in 1942. Since then, it has spread at an alarming rate to over 70 countries in Africa, the Middle East, Europe and Asia. Today, over 80 percent of the world’s sheep and goat populations are at risk. PPR causes annual economic losses of up to $2.1 billion, and is severely impacting 300 million poor households and their communities as they depend on the animals for their very survival.","Agriculture"
"[Banana Fusarium Wilt](http://www.fao.org/food-chain-crisis/how-we-work/plant-protection/banana-fusarium-wilt/en/) is one of the most destructive banana diseases worldwide. Its new race - Tropical Race 4 (TR4) - has been causing serious losses in Southeast Asia, leading to thousands of hectares of abandoned land. It has recently spread to the Middle East, Mozambique, and South Asia and is likely to spread further. Banana, together with plantains, is the most exported fruit in the world and the most produced food crop in least-developed countries. Some 400 million people rely on banana as staple food and source of income. FW can cause 100 percent yield loss in infested fields, jeopardizing the food security and livelihoods of rural communities, and the banana value chain.","Agriculture"

"The tsetse fly lives along the rivers Shabelle and Juba where it thrives in the region’s trees, bushes and high humidity. The fly is a carrier of trypanosomiasis disease, which has a devastating impact on the region’s livestock and economy.","Agriculture"
"In Balcad town, the pests are threatening livestock and the livelihoods of the pastoral communities who take their cattle to the Shabelle River there. The river is the lifeline for agriculture and agro-pastoralists who produce cotton, maize, fruits and vegetables in the town. However, it is during the rainy season that the flies thrive and breed in larger numbers.","Agriculture"
"""We have changed our grazing timings from day to night hours due to the increase of the deadly insect,"" says 39-year-old Mohammed Adow Diisow, who is a pastoralist in Bula Burwaqo, Balcad town. ""The riverbank is prone to tsetse flies and our major challenge is this disease (trypanosomiasis), which kills our livestock.""","Agriculture"
"Livestock specialists with the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) have trained the community animal health workers in livestock disease control. Through installation of NGU-type traps and pour-on treatment, the number of tsetse flies in the area has drastically reduced. The traps are made of blue and black cloth that attract the flies. Cow urine is also used to draw them in.","Agriculture"
"“We have reached our target in controlling the tsetse flies by installing 2,000 traps and treating more than 500,000 cattle in the riverine areas,” says Massimo Zecchini, ICRC’s livestock specialist in Somalia. “The local community are aware of the importance of the external parasites control and they are participating in the monitoring of the traps.”","Agriculture"
"The traps are a long-term sustainable solution for the community in the riverine areas. The control of the flies has benefited the community through increasing livestock production and improving animal health. This, in turn, has secured the economics of pastoral and agro-pastoral livelihoods in the area.","Agriculture"
"Since January, the ICRC has assisted more than a million drought affected people across Somalia by providing them with food, cash, and healthcare. It has also rehabilitated water points to ensure families have increased access for themselves and their animals.

"JUNE 2, 2017 FROM CGIAR News from CGIAR System Organization","Agriculture"
"The recent appearance of the fall armyworm, an insect-pest, which causes damage to more than 80 crop species in 14 countries in sub-Saharan Africa, poses a serious challenge and significant risk to the region’s food security.","Agriculture"
"In a recent interview, Dr B.M. Prasanna, director of the Global Maize Program, CIMMYT and the CGIAR Research Program on MAIZE, who is working at the forefront of CGIAR’s response, highlights the potential impact of the pest and how CGIAR researchers are contributing to a quick and coordinated response across the region.","Agriculture"
"**What is the fall armyworm and why is it so destructive?**","Agriculture"
"Prasanna: The fall armyworm (Spodoptera frugiperda) is an insect-pest which causes major damage to more than 80 crop species, including economically important crops, such as maize, rice, sorghum, wheat, sugarcane, several other vegetable crops and cotton.","Agriculture"
"It was first officially reported in Nigeria in early 2016, and since then, has been officially confirmed in 11, and suspected in at least 14 other African countries, as of April 2017.","Agriculture"
"**What are the potential impacts of the pest in sub-Saharan Africa?**","Agriculture"
"Prasanna: The fall armyworm poses a serious challenge and a significant, ongoing risk to Africa’s food security.","Agriculture"
"The pest’s ability to feed on a range of crop species means that smallholder farming systems in Africa, which are based on intercropping, are particularly vulnerable. Also, the rapid damage and migratory capacity of the pest, combined with its capacity to reproduce quickly in the right environmental conditions and its ability to rapidly evolve resistance to synthetic pesticides only serve to increase the region’s vulnerability.","Agriculture"
"In sub-Saharan Africa, where fall armyworm is currently devastating maize crops, estimates indicate 13.5 million tons of maize valued at $3 billion are at risk in 2017-2018, which is equivalent to over 20 percent of total production for the region (Based on data from CABI, April 2017)","Agriculture"
"**What are the key challenges that countries in sub-Saharan Africa will face?**","Agriculture"
"Prasanna: There is no doubt that small holder farmers, particularly maize farmers, in sub-Saharan Africa will face a significant and ongoing risk from the fall armyworm. In particular, resource-poor smallholders will be severely affected due to their inability to control the pest using synthetic pesticides (currently the only way to effectively respond), which are very costly.","Agriculture"
"**What are three ways that countries in sub-Saharan African can strengthen resilience of food and agricultural systems to the potential effects of Fall Armyworm?**","Agriculture"
"1\.Working groups need to be established quickly to develop and implement strategies to respond to the issue.  In particular, we need to develop a comprehensive, regional response centered on: Monitoring and early warning; Social and economic assessments of impacts, and forecasting; Integrated Pest Management (IPM); Development and dissemination of low-cost, effective and sustainable solutions and development of appropriate regulatory tools and policies to support the response.","Agriculture"
"2\. As this process unfolds, gaps, challenges and successes will need to be documented to inform capacity-building needs with a focus on understanding the capacity of individual countries to respond. While fall armyworm outbreaks across Africa is an emergency situation, it should also be an opportunity to review and understand regional food production and food security issues and as an opportunity to improve on systematic approaches to build capacity to prevent and respond to future threats of transboundary pests and pathogens in Africa.","Agriculture"
"3\. Strong coordination across different levels of government is required: “political coordination” (among the local governments, NPPOs, and sub-regional organizations), and “technical coordination” (fast-tracked testing and deployment of relevant technologies).","Agriculture"
"**What role do CIMMYT and CGIAR have in building capacity in the region’s ability to respond to Fall Armyworm?**","Agriculture"
"Prasanna: CGIAR institutions, including CIMMYT and the International Institute of Tropical Agriculture (IITA), have significant strengths in building the region’s ability to respond to trans-boundary pathogens (e.g., previous examples include Maize Lethal Necrosis [MLN]; wheat rust) and insect-pests, such as fall armyworm.","Agriculture"
"Specific examples of CGIAR/CIMMYT expertise that will be important in the fall armyworm response include:","Agriculture"
"1\. Development and dissemination of crowd-source based tools and digital surveillance systems and analysis of the data collected across countries for a strong monitoring and early warning system.    ","Agriculture"
"2\. Systematic and large-scale assessment of the present and potential socio-economic impact of fall armyworm in Africa, and the development of forecasting tools to understand potential losses     ","Agriculture"
"3\. Review of the efficacy of different fall armyworm management options (learning from experiences of the United States, Brazil and Mexico), and adapting this information to the African context     ","Agriculture"
"4\.     Determining the efficacy of cultural control options against fall armyworm, including early versus late planting of crops like maize, handpicking, soil and habitat management, crop hygiene, etc.","Agriculture"
"5.\ Evaluating the impacts on-going integrated pest management (IPM) initiatives and the impacts of the fall armyworm invasion on the effectiveness of these interventions     ","Agriculture"
"6\. Developing and implementing appropriate insect resistance monitoring and management strategy in fall armyworm affected countries     ","Agriculture"
"7\. Analysis of the effects of conservation agriculture on fall armyworm management and the influence of fall armyworm incidence on diverse cropping systems    ","Agriculture"
"8\. Testing and introgression of conventionally-derived resistance (from identified CIMMYT and U.S. Department of Agriculture-Agricultural Research Service [USDA-ARS] germplasm sources) into Africa-adapted maize germplasm, followed by fast-tracked varietal release, seed scale-up and delivery of improved maize hybrids/varieties through public-private partnerships (e.g., MLN is a great example of this).    ","Agriculture"

"- Total seasonal rainfall is above-average over most of the region (Figures 1 and 2) with the exception of few relatively small areas in the northern part of the Sahelian zone. ","Agriculture"
"- Rainfall deficits are minimal and are not expected to adversely affect crop development with the exception of the western part of the Senegal – Mauritania border area. ","Agriculture"
"- The western part of the Senegal-Mauritania border is the only area that suffers from both rainfall bad-time distribution (Figure 3) and severe seasonal deficit (Figure 2), a combination likely to hamper crop development in a significant way. ","Agriculture"
"- The medium-term forecast for the next two weeks (August 21th– September 4th) calls for moderate to heavy rains over the entire region, an indication of continued favorable agricultural conditions.","Agriculture"
"- The Intertropical Front’s (ITF) is now at its climatological position in its portion over Mali and Chad but about 1-1.5 degrees south of it in Mauritania and Niger. It underwent a 2-3 degrees of latitude drop compared to its position of the first dekad of August (Figure 4). However, the observed southward movement despite its relatively large size over Mali, Chad and Niger must be a part of normal fluctuations since it is too early for the southward retreat to start and also the medium term forecast calls for a significant amount of rainfall in the northern part of the region.

"- The “minor dry season” in the bi-modal zone continues normally. However, in the other agro-climatological zones rainfall continues in general to be favorable to crops and pastures. Few small areas in the Sahel have experienced deficits, but no negative effects on crops and range are expected since deficits are mostly light and coupled with a good time distribution of rainfall.

"- The only area of concern is the western part of the Senegal-Mauritania border. This is the only part of the region that has been experiencing severe rainfall deficits and 12-14 days of longest dry spell during the last 30 days as of August 20th. This area has to be closely monitored to assess the impact of dryness on crop performance.","Agriculture"

"- Rainfall has also been persistently heavy over the past month in western and central Yemen, Uganda, and western Kenya, and the start of season A has been reported in Burundi and Rwanda. Field reports indicate heavy rainfall has led to flooding and mudslides in parts of eastern Uganda.  ","Agriculture"
"- During the next two weeks, much of western and central Ethiopia, southern Sudan, South Sudan, and Uganda are expected to continue receiving widespread moderate to very heavy rainfall.

"Rainfall has also been persistently heavy over the past month in western and central Yemen, Uganda, and western Kenya. There are also recent field reports of floods and mudslides over Mt. Elgon region in eastern Uganda, more specifically in Nyundo, Bukimbiri, Harugale, Masaba, and Bumayoka districts where there were reports of property damage, human and livestock displacements in the past weeks. However, over the past month, rainfall has been below average (-25 to -100 mm) over some localized areas of western Karamoja regions and southern Uganda.","Agriculture"
"The timely to early onset of season A rains (late September to December) in Rwanda, Burundi and parts of eastern DRC are also likely to gradual improve the current rangeland resources and mark the crop planting season. A few areas over northern and southern Somalia also experienced unseasonal light to moderate rains during this time.","Agriculture"
"The Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) indicates near to slightly above average vegetation conditions in much of western Ethiopia, South Sudan, western Kenya and Karamoja in Uganda (Figure 2). Persistent cloud cover has remained and limited comprehensive monitoring of the current vegetation conditions in parts of western Ethiopia, southern Sudan and northeastern South Sudan. Nevertheless, cropping conditions in many high-producing rainfed agricultural areas of Sudan appear to be average tending to above average, following very favorable performance of main season rainfall. However, NDVI suggests there are significant areas of Kassala, northern Gadaref, and southern North Darfur where seasonal vegetation growth was delayed and vegetation conditions remain below average.","Agriculture"
"Field reports further suggest cropping, particularly in Kassala and northern Gadaref, was significantly impacted by early season dry spells and that area planted in those areas was below normal. Moreover, excessive and persistent rainfall over eastern Sudan has caused crop damage and loss due to waterlogging and reported flash floods in Sennar and surrounding states. In Ethiopia, although seasonal rainfall has been average or above average in most western areas, crops planted during the Belg but harvested during the Meher are likely to suffer from reduced yields, particularly in SNNPR, where a late start of season reduced the length of the growing season for long-cycle crops. Cropping prospects are also poorer than usual in western Kenya due to the erratic but early onset of its seasonal rains in late Feb/early March, coupled with the extensive Fall Armyworm (FAW) infestation of the young maize crop in Uasin-Gishu and Trans-Nzoia counties.","Agriculture"
"Meanwhile, much of the Horn of Africa has remained seasonally dry with very low levels of pasture and water following consecutive seasons of drought, particularly in southeastern Ethiopia, most of Somalia, and northern Kenya. Recent off-season rainfall in western areas of Kenya have led to significantly improved water and forage availability.","Agriculture"
"The following is a country-by-country update on recent seasonal progress to date:","Agriculture"
"- In Sudan, main season rainfall has continued to be average tending to above average over most parts of Sudan during the month of September, which has been mostly favorable for crop production in most high-producing areas. Field reports suggest extensive flooding has occurred, including in eastern and western Sudan, which has resulted in damage to crops and property. Presently, five of the worst flood affected areas in Sudan are El Fashir, Nyala, Delgo, Singa, Halafaya El Gezira, and Atbara.  ","Agriculture"
"- In Ethiopia, Kiremt rainfall has been largely average or above average, since the start of the cropping season in early June and is forecast to continue into the end of September. However, Belg crops harvested in the Meher were also affected by an erratic start of season and could suffer from reduced yields. The infestation FAW on an estimated 22 percent of the maize area planted is likely to reduce maize production in some areas.  ","Agriculture"
"- In Kenya, unseasonal rains between July and mid-September in northwestern counties of Turkana, West Pokot, Baringo, and northwestern portions of Marsabit have been generally beneficial in replenishment of rangeland resources and led to improvements in livestock body conditions. However, due to the prolonged drought in other pastoral areas over northeastern and southern regions of Kenya, rangeland conditions have continued to deteriorate in the past month.  ","Agriculture"
"- In Somalia, conditions remain drier than normal. However, there is an increased likelihood for moderate to heavy rains in the coming two weeks over northern Somalia as indicated in GFS rainfall forecasts.  ","Agriculture"
"- In Uganda, rainfall in Karamoja in September was above average tending to average and total cumulative rainfall for the June – September season is expected to be above average. The September to November second rainy season in bimodal regions started earlier than usual in many areas and rainfall totals have been above average since August.  ","Agriculture"
"- In South Sudan, the first season harvest is ongoing in Greater Equatoria and the green harvest is available in Greater Bahr el Ghazal and Greater Upper Nile. Despite average to above-average seasonal rainfall, production is expected to be well below average as a result of widespread civil insecurity. Crop damage due to Fall Army Worm (FAW) is also likely to have adverse impacts in regions worst affected by the pest, especially in Torit, Magwi, Budi, Juba, and Aweil.  ","Agriculture"
"- In Yemen, the second season (July to September) rainfall performance has been generally above average over its southwestern highlands and into parts of central and eastern pastoral areas. However, conflict continues to disrupt agricultural activities in worst-affected areas.  ","Agriculture"
"- In DRC, seasonal rainfall during the month of September below average (-50 to -100mm) over northeastern, east-central and southeastern areas bordering Uganda, Rwanda, and Burundi.  ","Agriculture"
"- In Burundi and Rwanda, the September to December 2017 rainy season has begun, and eastern areas of Rwanda have received above-average rainfall. Land preparation efforts for Season A are underway in both countries.  ","Agriculture"
"- In Tanzania, the northwestern and Lake Victoria regions bordering Uganda, Rwanda, and Burundi received above-average rainfall amounts in September.

"PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti – More than 4,300 animals have been treated in northeastern Haiti at mobile clinics set up by Heifer International and the Ministry of Agriculture in the wake of Hurricane Irma. Teams are preparing to care for more livestock as Hurricane Maria threatens the country.","Agriculture"
"Natural disasters can be just as hard on livestock as they are on people, and many animals have been left injured, stressed or infected with parasites after the storm.","Agriculture"
"“The resiliency of rural communities – their ability to bounce back from disasters – is closely tied to the health and well-being of their livestock – which often serve as emergency funds and savings accounts for small-scale farmers,” said Hervil Cherubin, country director for Heifer in Haiti.","Agriculture"
"As Irma churned toward Haiti, a group of veterinary technicians – trained by Heifer and Haiti’s Ministry of Agriculture – began preparing to treat the livestock that survived the hurricane. Warning messages were sent via mobile phone and social media, advising farmers how to protect their animals.","Agriculture"
"After the storm, the veterinary technicians set up mobile clinics in five communities in the northeast: Dumas, Ouanaminthe, Ferrier, Malfety and Grand Bassin. They treated 4,323 animals, mostly cattle, goats, pigs, donkeys and horses. Some dogs and cats also received care.","Agriculture"
"“The children are always the most excited about helping the veterinary technicians because of the opportunity to be part of such a community event,” Cherubin said. “It’s also an opportunity to contribute to the protection of the family assets. They already know that their school tuition might be paid by one of their goats.”","Agriculture"
"Haiti didn’t suffer a direct hit from Irma as it did one year ago when Hurricane Matthew devastated the country.

"For many livestock keepers in South Sudan, there is little that can be done to help a sick or injured animal. “If one of our cows was sick, it was either slaughtered or left to die because we didn’t know how to deal with sick cows,” says Marial Madit, from the Maraya cattle camp in Aweial County. But now, Madit has new knowledge and tools to help heal a sick animal. Along with 24 other young South Sudanese, Madit recently completed a FAO-sponsored training to become a Community Animal Health Worker.","Agriculture"
"In South Sudan, the death of an animal is the loss of an important asset. Cattle are used not only for milk and meat, but also to pay dowry, what a man must give to a woman’s family before he is able to marry her. Sick livestock can also mean decreased production and limited marketing opportunities, explains Marco Makur Nyariel, a FAO Animal Health Officer based in Rumbek. “If your livestock is sick you may not be able to get good milk. You also may not be able to take care of your family,” he says.","Agriculture"
"But despite the cultural and economic importance of livestock in South Sudan, access to veterinary care is limited. “During the many years of fighting between the north and the south…. the line of the education system within South Sudan was affected during the war,” says Nyariel, explaining why very few South Sudanese have been trained in veterinary medicine.","Agriculture"
"What’s more, many livestock keepers live in remote “cattle camps”, where bad roads and insecurity can make access difficult. To help solve that problem, FAO is giving basic veterinary training to people who, like Marial Madit, already live in the cattle camps. The Organization is also supporting the state and national Ministries of Livestock, Animal Resources and Fisheries to fill this gap.","Agriculture"
"For two weeks in June, Madit and other trainees from Lakes State gathered in the town of Yirol for a two-week workshop. They learned about vaccination, prevention and treatment of diseases affecting cattle, sheep, goats and poultry. The trainees were also taught how to get rid of ticks and lice, which can transmit diseases that weaken the animals. At the end of the course, the newly-trained Community Animal Health Workers were given veterinary medicine and tools, and then sent back to work in their communities. Less than a month later, the trainees were already making a difference in the cattle camps where they live.","Agriculture"
"“With the training we had last time in Yirol, I have been able to identify the different diseases that have been attacking our cattle and managed to treat some of these diseases,” says Ding Anyoun Gak, who lives in the War-Abyei cattle camp near Rumbek. “We have been able to treat diseases and pests like ticks, also sometimes the cattle come back from grazing when they have wounds that they got from animal attacks that as well we have been able to manage,” adds Aborpei Gumwel, another Community Animal Health Worker at War-Abyei.","Agriculture"
"But Nyariel says that in addition to caring for livestock, the Community Animal Health Workers can also help create a more peaceful society. Every time the Animal Health Workers treat an animal, they are also encouraged to talk to the people about managing resources. Cattle raiding and disputes over pasture and water often causes fighting between cattle camps.","Agriculture"
"“We must cooperate and talk about how to manage our natural resources for the benefit of our livestock and to avoid conflict,” says Nyariel.  “The most important thing that you must put in your mind is that without peace you will not be able to do treatment, without peace you will not be able to do livestock vaccination.”","Agriculture"

Across the region, there have been more than 30 deaths in 5 countries, with over 40,000 displaced, 2 million evacuated in Cuba alone, and thousands of homes damaged or destroyed.

"On top of the loss of life and demolished infrastructure, the toll of climate-related disasters weighs heavily on development prospects in small island states. As just one example, Barbuda’s efforts to achieve 100 percent green energy by 2020 will be derailed as it works to rebuild basic infrastructure and support for its citizens. The absence of financing for reconstruction in small island states risks impacting growth, education, health, and the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals. ","Recovery and Reconstruction"
"The OECD has long been calling on the international community to rethink approaches to support for small island states, in particular how to better manage their transition from low-income to developed country status so that they are not left vulnerable to being knocked backwards in times of natural disaster. A [2016 OECD report](https://reliefweb.int/report/world/climate-and-disaster-resilience-financing-small-island-developing-states) laid out how small islands are hardest hit by the impacts of disasters, making up two-thirds of the countries that suffer the highest relative losses due to natural disasters on an annual basis – losses that amount to 1-9% of their GDP each year. The OECD is currently developing a new body of evidence to unpack the consequences of transition from low-income status in small island states and other countries.","Recovery and Reconstruction"
"The relief effort for island territories hit by the recent spate of storms has prompted a public debate over the way Official Development Assistance (ODA) is allocated to countries classed as low-income, unlike humanitarian aid.

"The OECD’s Development Assistance Committee of donor countries agreed in 2014 on the importance of allocating more official aid to countries most in need, including small island states, and the DAC is actively discussing how more ODA could be used to leverage additional private resources, for example through so-called blended finance – the strategic use of public or private investment with a development objective to mobilise additional finance for SDG-aligned investments in poor countries. While this will not take the place of ODA, there is a need for innovative solutions to address the dual challenge of the global development goals: to activate unprecedented volumes of resources and leave no one behind.","Recovery and Reconstruction"
"A new OECD report due out in October – Making International Cooperation Work for Small Island Developing States, 2017 – highlights the need to better address the specific challenges faced by small island states. We need faster responses to humanitarian needs and greater efforts to rebuild in a way that fosters long-term resilience.

These include a complex system of defining eligibility for such finance, and a cumbersome array of accreditation procedures and application processes that often exceed these small island states’ administrative, institutional and technical capacities.","Recovery and Reconstruction"
"The OECD will continue to work more broadly to find ways the development community can better support small states or territories that grow economically to a level where they are not ODA-eligible but still face significant and unique development challenges.

"A review of recent humanitarian interventions that support local markets in emergency contexts revealed a limited scope and breadth of this type of activity. While many agencies show good creativity and understanding of market systems in emergencies, most activities are in the form of small grants to traders, to help them recover and to facilitate access to markets for disaster-affected communities. Such support includes small and large, formal and informal traders, but does not often go beyond grants, although sometimes trainings and other “soft support” are provided. The limited scope of market support activities is probably linked to the focused scope of many emergency market analyses or response analysis efforts that may not study all market actors or adequately consider market support activities, due to time constraints or simply humanitarians’ comfort level.

"The objectives of the Final Evaluation as per Terms of Reference (ToR) are the following:","Recovery and Reconstruction"
"1. Assess the overall achievement of results of the response program based on the logframe and focusing on the livelihoods recovery component, specifically pointing to evidence that the program was able to contribute to positive changes in communities’ lives.","Recovery and Reconstruction"
"2. Evaluate program performance under the four major themes – program delivery model, integration of gender equality and disaster risk reduction (DRR), partnership strategy, and accountability principles and practices. The four main evaluation criteria used are effectiveness, efficiency, impact, and sustainability.","Recovery and Reconstruction"
"3. Identify lessons learned, good practices and any particular challenges in the implementation of the program and achievement of results 4. Provide recommendations to improve future programming.  ","Recovery and Reconstruction"
"The Evaluation employed the combination of utilization-focused and participatory approaches in the collection and analysis of results. The latter was realized through the involvement of a substantive sample of stakeholders for the livelihoods component in surveys, focus group discussions (FGDs), and key informant interviews (KIIs).  ","Recovery and Reconstruction"
"The following are the output achievements of the Program:","Recovery and Reconstruction"
"- 27,415 men and women who have used cash grants to jump start quick-impact livelihoods and attended income-generating activity (IGA) planning and money management orientation. Top five livelihoods that beneficiaries embarked on were rearing pig and chicken, sari-sari (retail) store, retail trading (various types), and tied to fifth place are vegetable farming and food vending.","Recovery and Reconstruction"
"- 25,330 men and women who received additional cash grants to expand and diversify livelihoods","Recovery and Reconstruction"
"- 284 community enterprises accessed livelihood support funds covering 16 types of commodities (rice, cassava, other rootcrops, abaca, tikog, other materials for handicraft, herbs, vegetable, vermicompost, seaweeds, ginger, banana, native chicken, aqua/marine, other agri crops, others) at four stages of the value chain (input supply, production, processing, and marketing, including logistics/transport)","Recovery and Reconstruction"
"- 38,566 men and women participated in community enterprise projects","Recovery and Reconstruction"
"- 912 women’s enterprises expanded and diversified. Majority of the beneficiaries are engaged in food vending. The rest are in agriculture (agricultural crop, marine/aquaculture, poultry/livestock), handicraft, textile products, and services.","Recovery and Reconstruction"
"- 39,478 men and women engaged in community and women-owned enterprises participated in trainings such as community-based enterprise development (C-BED), gender, disaster risk reduction, and business planning The livelihood component has contributed to the achievement of Program objectives. The financial assistance, complemented by capacity building and technical assistance, has increased the capacity of men and women to implement profitable and sustainable enterprises.  ","Recovery and Reconstruction"
"Survey in December 2016 showed that a little over half of beneficiaries (55%) were even able to diversify their respective livelihoods. For women entrepreneurs in particular, 80% have increased confidence in managing their respective enterprises compared to 31.5% in June 2016. Women played a substantial role in the strategic business decision-making process.  ","Recovery and Reconstruction"
"Moreover, 80% were able to establish market linkages. The types of markets are walk-in buyers (21%), retailers (6%), wholesalers (4%), institutional buyers (1%), and various/multiple (55%).  ","Recovery and Reconstruction"
"Market transactions are primarily happening at the barangay level (31%). Households implementing the three tracks of livelihood support have earned income: 73% of household cash transfer beneficiaries earned income with a monthly net average of Php 2,785.15 compared to the previous Php 2,000 per month; 100% of women enterprise beneficiaries with a monthly net average of Php 4,382.09 compared to Php 412 before; and 36% of households participating in community enterprises with monthly net average of Php 42,050 compared to Php 40,850 before.  ","Recovery and Reconstruction"
"From their income, beneficiaries were able to acquire household assets such as appliances and electronic gadgets (52%), furniture and fixtures (18%), and motorcycle (30%). They were also able to acquire productive assets: 63% own small livestock, 53% farm equipment (non mechanized), 5% farm equipment (mechanized), and tools (49%). Acquisition of assets was made possible either through the financial grant or income from CARE-assisted enterprises.  ","Recovery and Reconstruction"
"Three years after typhoon Haiyan, affected communities are on their way to recovery and resilience as shown by the following:","Recovery and Reconstruction"
"- Households were able to meet or attain basic needs such as food (95%) and education (97%) compared to the pre-typhoon levels. On the other hand, health (93%) and shelter (88%) were partially improved/met while debt payment (48%) and savings (81%) are not improved or not yet met.","Recovery and Reconstruction"
"- Use of negative coping mechanisms was reduced. The percentage of people employing each of the nine negative coping mechanisms was reduced after the introduction of CARE’s program. As CARE was the major implementer of livelihoods in each Barangay, it is reasonable to assume that CARE’s intervention contributed to this reduction. Much fewer people are modifying food consumption of the households such as limiting meal portions, purchasing less preferred items, reducing number of meals eaten in a day, and borrowing food from others. Likewise, there has also been reduction in the use of nonfood negative coping mechanisms such as decreasing health/education/incomegenerating expenditures. Very few respondents used erosive coping mechanisms such as sale of assets or sending family members away to work.","Recovery and Reconstruction"
"- Households were able to employ livelihood protection mechanisms through cash transfers by CARE (shelter and livelihoods), and through replacement or rebuilding of assets either through the financial assistance from CARE and through the income from their enterprise operations.  ","Recovery and Reconstruction"
"The following are the findings related to program performance:","Recovery and Reconstruction"
"- The vulnerability of the beneficiaries were generally characterized by lack of disposable income, a limited asset base and livelihood opportunities. Efforts to address these issues mainly took the form of providing financial assistance, building human capacity (through trainings), group formation, and linking to financial services. Providing both financial and capacity development assistance helped in increasing local capacity in managing enterprises.","Recovery and Reconstruction"
"- Some livelihood activities are more appropriate or are the better option for some local economic and environmental contexts at particular points in time. During the early recovery phase, the goal was to provide quick-impact, low-capital livelihood activities through household cash transfers. For medium-term recovery, the goal was to promote market-oriented livelihood, or micro or small business enterprise through the CEFs and WEFs. Cash transfer pooling was one of the more exceptional and fruitful ways of starting a group-owned micro-enterprise. The collaborative micro-enterprises showed some scale up and sustainability potentials that eventually developed through the CEF.","Recovery and Reconstruction"
"- The use of the value chain approach supports the ongoing effort to increase revenue, to access a range of livelihood assets, and to reduce operating costs of micro-enterprises.  ","Recovery and Reconstruction"
"WEF and CEF projects have been increasingly directed towards enterprises that have strong market scale-up potential through greater backward, forward and horizontal linkages. A more market-oriented livelihood assistance provided to the households played an important means in recovery especially in places where farming and fishing could not be immediately resumed. Moreover, the Program has identified and engaged partners to complete a network that provides beneficiaries with access to a range of livelihood assets, e.g., marketing, technical and business development support services, financing, and risk protection services such as insurance and risk mapping.","Recovery and Reconstruction"
"- Partnership with competent facilitating partners has enhanced the importance of community facilitators who are experts in enterprise management, understand the local value chain and know key industry players. For example, CARE benefitted from BizFTC that is knowledgeable on enterprise risk management, or from Antique Development Foundation that has a wealth of experience in community enterprise development and local government networks. Fatima Cooperative has post-harvest facilities and network system for savings build-up. It facilitated the work of CARE and the Program beneficiaries making productive use of local resources like cassava in building capital from their own savings.","Recovery and Reconstruction"
"- Important partners from the government and private sector were identified for the beneficiaries with the adoption of the value chain approach. Contracting agreements for training and coaching activities, provision of farm machineries and equipment, and marketing partnerships were made to ensure more long-term results. In partnership agreements with the government, the Program ensured that there is no duplication but instead complementation of programs.","Recovery and Reconstruction"
"- The gender strategy was very relevant and appropriate to the livelihood recovery as well as to the longer-term challenges beneficiaries face in building competitive, growthoriented and sustainable livelihoods. The gender-responsive value chain analysis facilitated the identification of gender issues and identified ways and means of integrating women’s and men’s needs and opportunities in the enterprises. The integration of gender in needs assessment, proposal development, activities and outcomes was done promptly.","Recovery and Reconstruction"
"- The disaster risk reduction – climate change adaptation (DRR-CCA) practices adopted particularly in the value chain analysis and enterprise activities contributed to minimizing enterprise risks and maximizing results. Mainstreaming climate change and disaster risk reduction involved mobilizing beneficiaries and communities to increase their awareness of local DRR-CCA issues and the importance of environmental sustainability, and develop a shared approach to addressing community enterprise priorities.","Recovery and Reconstruction"
"- CARE exercises ‘do no harm’ policy and communicate key accountability principles throughout the phases of the program cycle. CARE and local facilitating partners made a deliberate effort to identify and prioritize households that needed most help. They consulted these households about their needs for livelihoods recovery. Protocols for communicating beneficiaries’ complaints and grievances to CARE and the local facilitating partners provided particular assistance needed.  ","Recovery and Reconstruction"
"The evaluation identified the following key challenges:While the shifts from HHCT to WEF and CEF were noted and successes were reported, these were achieved not without overcoming challenges. Among the challenges encountered were: a) low production level due to lack of good equipment; b) inability to reach demand requirements of the market; and c) upgraded enterprise management skills of the CEF project management that meet the standards of the markets.  ","Recovery and Reconstruction"
"The following are the most meaningful lessons from the Program that can provide decision makers with relevant information for future programming:","Recovery and Reconstruction"
"1. A sustainable livelihood program can improve the poor’s ability to protect and promote their economic conditions when this includes a comprehensive analysis of vulnerability context of their livelihood conditions. Based on HHCT experience, vulnerable households tend to allocate their scarce resources to maintain consumption levels and reduce risk rather than to maximize profit or income as in the case of WEF beneficiaries.","Recovery and Reconstruction"
"2. In designing inclusive and market-oriented livelihood intervention, the use of value chain approach for priority sector could guide the beneficiaries in identifying opportunities in the market, and consider the constraints to exploiting these opportunities. To provide a foundation for analysis and technical guidance, the assistance from facilitating partners in undertaking a detailed value chain analysis is one good approach.","Recovery and Reconstruction"
"3. Providing business advisory support services, including access to market information, financing facilitation, technology transfer, business counselling, marketing and product development, rather than working with traditional business support systems, is important to the success of these enterprises. However, available resources and capacity should match the level of enterprise development of the beneficiaries.","Recovery and Reconstruction"
"4. Engaging with national and local government, non-government organizations and the private sector facilitates the sustainability of these initiatives as these institutions can provide the necessary support services, particularly in the provision of technical and financial assistance for the scaling of production and business operations.","Recovery and Reconstruction"
"5. A holistic approach to gender mainstreaming is important for livelihood intervention of any kind to build deeper attitudinal and behavioural changes and greater levels of economic empowerment and participation in enterprise decision-making.","Recovery and Reconstruction"
"6. Intensive monitoring and evaluation is important to track that beneficiaries and partners graduate to the next level of results. Monitoring will keep track of progress of the beneficiaries’ enterprises and provide much-needed focused support.  ","Recovery and Reconstruction"
"The following recommendations will enhance the future programming:","Recovery and Reconstruction"
"1. An integrated livelihood program employing market-oriented approaches is an appropriate response to ensure resilience of the livelihood enterprises. To ensure its sustainability, a comprehensive support of value chain analysis and upgrading and technical expertise on entrepreneurship, and results-based monitoring and evaluation approaches should be provided through competent facilitating partners or service facilitators or providers.","Recovery and Reconstruction"
"2. The existing collaboration of individual and community enterprises with government agencies and private sector players can still be strengthened for better impacts. These include coordination with local stakeholders to provide more efficient and effective delivery service and to link beneficiaries with business support systems such as markets, technology and finance.","Recovery and Reconstruction"
"3. Capacity-building efforts must focus on the delivery of the business support services as well as in managing risks. Institutions that are not able to manage risks effectively can quickly become overwhelmed, seriously jeopardizing their ability to continue to provide services.","Recovery and Reconstruction"
"4. Improve program monitoring and evaluation systems and tools, and ensure their integration with facilitating partners’ tools and systems. Weaknesses in tracking results should be addressed through additional training and technical assistance for partners to adopt appropriate tools for monitoring and evaluation at the project level. Additional support is needed for program staff to improve analysis of monitoring and evaluation results.","Recovery and Reconstruction"

"Nepal experienced incessant rainfall from August 11 to 14, 2017, resulting in widespread floods across 35 of the country’s 77 districts.1 Several districts experienced the heaviest rainfall in over 60 years. This led to the inundation of about 80 percent of the land in substantial parts of the Terai region.","Recovery and Reconstruction"
"Floods have historically resulted from a combination of the following natural factors in Nepal: continuous rainfall and cloudbursts, snowmelt and rainfall, glacial lake outburst floods and bishyari (breaking of dams caused by landslides falling directly into rivers). This year’s heavy rains were a result of the monsoon trough, an elongated area of low pressure that formed parallel to the foothills of the Himalayas; presence of low-pressure and the entry of moisture from the Bay of Bengal that released significant rains on the southern parts of the Chure range and the mid-hills. Shifting of the monsoon trough closer and away from Nepal is a common phenomenon. However, this year it extended from the east to the west of the country, causing heavy rains. ","Recovery and Reconstruction"
"The monsoon is both a productive and hazardous resource in Nepal. When it brings the right amount of rain, agriculture productivity soars; when there is excess, it causes tremendous loss of life and property. During monsoon cloudbursts, landslides and flash floods occur in the mountains. In the southern plains, the same water breaches river banks and inundates swathes of land. The impact is aggravated by rapid urbanization in the Terai: physical construction along the embankments have interfered with the existing patterns of surface water flow and caused drainage congestion. With local hydrology changed, there has been flooding even in regions with no past experience of such calamities.","Recovery and Reconstruction"
"The booming construction industry has also driven up the demand for sand and gravel, usually mined from upstream river beds in the dry season. During the monsoon, the loosened sediments are transported downstream, which elevate the beds of river, causing them to meander and flood.","Recovery and Reconstruction"
"The 2017 flood spanned the entire breadth of the country. A total of 35 districts were affected of which 18 of them severely (see Figure 1). More than 190,000 houses were destroyed or partially damaged, displacing tens of thousands of people and rendering many homeless. Household assets and food grains were damaged and the affected communities faced shortage of food, water and non-food items. Many suffered infections from contaminated water.  ","Recovery and Reconstruction"
"In comparison to the past floods in 2001 and 2008, which killed 1,673 people, the 2017 floods saw reduced mortality and injuries. The number of people who died in the 18 most affected districts was 134 of which 44 were female. The districts where most of the deaths occurred are as follows: Rautahat, Morang, Jhapa and Sarlahi. The number of recorded injuries caused by the floods this year was only 22. In the severely affected 18 districts, the floods affected a total of around 1.7 million people (866,993 male and 821,480 female).","Recovery and Reconstruction"

"**UNDP SUPPORT TO RECOVERY AND RISK MANAGEMENT**","Recovery and Reconstruction"
"The man with the questions is Dr. Muhi Usamah.  Dr. Usamah is a United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) Landslide Risk-Management Specialist. Having arrived in Sierra Leone, three weeks after the disaster, to provide support to Sierra Leone’s Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), he is one of a team of experts conducting assessments and analysis to inform the Government-commissioned Recovery and Risk Management Action Plan for Sierra Leone.  With academic backgrounds and extensive experience across a range of expertise areas, these specialists will propose solutions to immediate, medium, and long-term challenges; address both environmental and urban development issues; and enable national-planning that is evidence-based and risk-informed.","Recovery and Reconstruction"
"On this particular day, Dr. Usamah and his EPA counterparts are visiting communities along the disaster site.","Recovery and Reconstruction"
"Having moved upward, nearer to the source of the landslide, the team is graciously welcomed by those who remain close to the area where they last saw their loved ones.  Each has his or her story to tell.  These stories are difficult to hear and it is difficult not to fixate on the personal items that remain, half buried in mud and rubble: clothes, shoes, and children’s toys.","Recovery and Reconstruction"
"In the mountainous terrain where homes and families were consumed by heavy, wet mud, just weeks ago, other homes stand to each side in stark contrast, untouched and surrounded by greenery.  But where most of us see rocks and dirt, Dr. Usamah sees “exposed sub-surface geology”, “soil characteristics” and “weathering processes.” ","Recovery and Reconstruction"
"His work in Sierra Leone has been a two-step process.  The first component involved a joint UNDP/EPA analysis of the environmental causes of the mudslide, and the human activities that trigger them.  The second component is to produce a comprehensive set of recommendations for sustainable landslide risk management both in Freetown and in other landslide prone areas in Sierra Leone.","Recovery and Reconstruction"
"As more and more people relocate from rural to urban areas, one can observe massive landscape change around Freetown, as green areas are transformed into settlements.  Sierra Leone is undergoing rapid physical development.  Dr. Usamah cautions, “Development that is not risk-informed will not be sustainable.”  It was not only lives and homes that were destroyed on 14 August.  Many people lost their livelihoods and their entire life savings.  They are no longer experiencing the benefits of development and it will take time for them to recover the standard of living they had known. ","Recovery and Reconstruction"
"Development and disaster risk-reduction are not two separate issues. It’s not only about “responding” to disasters, but also about understanding their causes and integrating this knowledge into plans, so that risk is mitigated in the first place.","Recovery and Reconstruction"
"**COORDINATED APPROACH: POLICY MAKERS AND COMMUNITIES**","Recovery and Reconstruction"
"Risk-informed development also requires a coordinated approach, with responsible actors at all levels.  It should come from the top down, but also from the bottom up – from national-level planning to community-level action. ","Recovery and Reconstruction"
"At a national policy level, disaster risk-management could include the establishment and implementation of relevant building codes and by-laws, early warning systems, and contingency plans. In fact, many of the UNDP Expert’s recommendations relate to the need to establish policies and to ensure their strict implementation.  This is critical in making it clear which areas are safe or unsafe to live.","Recovery and Reconstruction"
"The type of risk-assessments that have been conducted by UNDP and the EPA could also inform local-level preparedness.  They could, for example inform emergency evacuation and contingency plans.","Recovery and Reconstruction"
"Communities are also well-positioned to advocate risk-awareness and their participation is critical.  The communities of Sierra Leone are resilient, strong, and close knit.  Trusted community leaders – youth leaders, religious leaders – must play a role in delivering important, life-saving messages.  It is time to abandon the idea that “nothing will happen” and recognize that “anything can happen” at any time. ","Recovery and Reconstruction"
"According to Dr. Usamah, “We know that there will be more floods, mudslides, and landslides in the future.  We just don’t know when.” The key is to raise awareness so that people are fully aware that they are living with risk and are able to make informed decisions.","Recovery and Reconstruction"

"Older people set up small enterprises selling goods such as rice, soap and palm oil, while a number of communities initiated collective groundnut or rice farms. Once they had made enough money, they paid back their loans to the community group with a small amount of interest, which was used to issue further loans to members.","Recovery and Reconstruction"

The parties decided to work together to do everything possible to provide the people on the islands with emergency aid and assist with reconstruction. Dutch foreign minister Bert Koenders said on behalf of the four constituent countries of the Kingdom that he hoped the UN would respond quickly and flexibly to the needs of the population. ‘This is no time for red tape,’ he said.","Recovery and Reconstruction"

He also expressed his thanks for the assistance provided so far and asked that it be continued.","Recovery and Reconstruction"
"‘Hurricane Irma has caused widespread destruction,’ the minister said. ‘Many people have lost their homes and there is major damage to the infrastructure. It will be a huge job to restore everything. So I call on the UN to be generous with contributions from its funds and to make expertise available for the reconstruction of St Maarten.’","Recovery and Reconstruction"
"Many UN organisations are already at work in the affected areas, establishing needs, helping assess the risk of infectious diseases, distributing high-energy biscuits and providing technical assistance. The UN’s development programme has also made $2 million available for the Caribbean islands hit by Irma, while the UN’s emergency relief coordinator is providing $10 million.","Recovery and Reconstruction"
"Mr Koenders believes the UN should appoint a special envoy for climate and security, who should focus on how climate change affects security. ‘We may well face hurricanes of this strength again,’ he said. ‘Small island states in the Caribbean are extremely vulnerable, and as we’ve seen, can be completely destroyed in a matter of hours. The UN plays a crucial role in developing plans in order to anticipate these risks and respond appropriately.

"After the devastating destruction caused by Typhoon Yolanda on November 8th 2013, which affected over 14 million people and cost the lives of at least 6,000 people, thousands of families still live in fear and unsafe conditions. As part of the humanitarian recovery and rehabilitation response, ACTED with support from Agence Française de Développement (AFD), ALSTOM Foundation and Lafarge implemented a multi-sector project which included the construction of 126 resilient shelters – “Eastwinds Residences” and supporting income generating activities of 38 beneficiaries. The project has come to a closure, with beneficiaries moving into their shelters and starting a new chapter in their lives. Below are several testimonials as the moves are made.","Recovery and Reconstruction"
"**Rona –“A two-storey concrete shelter! Who would have thought?”**","Recovery and Reconstruction"
"Living in the “no build zone” was terrifying for Rona and her family of 4 children as they were exposed to dangers posed by natural disasters, having survived through Typhoon Haiyan. However, as her husband earns a living for the family from fishing, the family did not have the financial capacity to move elsewhere.","Recovery and Reconstruction"
"No time was wasted moving into her new home in Eastwinds Residences. The residences, built within a safe location, are resilient to withstand typhoon winds. Beautifications of the house have been well underway, such as installing curtains, planting roses outside the house and painting the interior green. She has not been able to start her food vending livelihood business in the market as it is not fully functioning yet as families are slowly moving into their homes. Rona is still getting used to living in a two-storey concrete house with her family as she never expected that would be a reality.","Recovery and Reconstruction"
"Maria, her husband and four children were severely affected by Typhoon Haiyan, as their small house and pump boat were washed away during the disaster. As the family depended on fishing, the loss of the pump boat was devastating. The proposition by ACTED for Maria to set up an alternative livelihood and move her family into a resilient and safe shelter were immediately welcomed.","Recovery and Reconstruction"
"As the market in the Eastwinds Residences is not fully running yet due to many families still making the move, Maria is concentrated now on enhancing the interior of her new home. She has painted the inside of the house blue and pink and placed curtains on the second floor. After officially moving the family in and the presence of the community grows she plans to start selling her fruits and vegetables in the local market built in the residences by ACTED. This will provide an alternative source of income for her family.","Recovery and Reconstruction"
"**Winona – “ACTED is now associated to me with the words safe shelter”**","Recovery and Reconstruction"
"It has now been a month that Winona, her husband and five children have moved into their new safe permanent shelter. Due to the successive days of bad weather, Winona and her family immediately moved into their new shelter as their home in Barangay 07 was located in the “no build zone” above the sea water.","Recovery and Reconstruction"
"With a family’s minimal income, Winona never expected her family would be able to move into a two storey concrete house that is safe and not located near the “no build zone” She and her family can now feel safe and no longer afraid they will be affected by bad weather or high tide waters. She’s elated they now have their own latrine and no longer need to share!","Recovery and Reconstruction"
"Like most of the beneficiaries, Jenoveva has spent the last few weeks enhancing the interior of her families’ new shelter. The family directly moved in due to the bad weather, which posed a severe risk in her previous home and generated fear amongst the family. Today however her family no longer has to worry about being safe, instead about planting flowery plants along the veranda and how to build a second kitchen at the back of the house.","Recovery and Reconstruction"

"In Lenge’i village, Samburu County, access to safe water has for years been a big challenge due to poor infrastructural development. The area receives very little rainfall subsequently affecting the surface and sub-surface water recharge rates. Recurrent droughts have led to increased distances and time spent in search of safe water.","Water Sanitation Hygiene"
"In Lenge’i village, only one borehole, drilled to the depth of 97 meters, is available for use, serving some 2,400 people. The borehole has a discharge rate of 1m3 per hour to sufficiently serve the community. “We were very privileged to have a borehole drilled in 2007 to provide safe water for the community,” said Arguel Lekumoisa, the former Assistant Chief of Lenge’i and a member of the Lenge’i Water User Committee. The only challenge the community has been facing is that since it was drilled, no plans were put in place to clean it. Due to increased use during the long dry season coupled with a lack of maintenance, the community has been struggling to channel water to the extended kiosk that serves nearby households. The productivity of the borehole reduced greatly during the extensive past drought, which prompted the community to seek for help to rehabilitate the borehole.","Water Sanitation Hygiene"
"**Cleaning the borehole to ensure access to clean drinking water for the community**","Water Sanitation Hygiene"
"ACTED, through the Water Department of Samburu County Government, and with financial support of UNICEF, was in charge of cleaning and flushing out sediments from the borehole to ensure access to clean drinking water for the community, while sensitizing community members on the importance of cleaning and maintaining the water infrastructure. “During the borehole cleaning process, we were shocked to see the dirty water and silt that came out of it,” said one of the community members. After the borehole was rehabilitated, community members witnessed an increased yield and were then able to pump and provide enough water for their tanks, cattle troughs and the water kiosk used by nearby villages. “We no longer queue for water as was the case before and our animals have enough water at the cattle trough. Our living standards have improved greatly with the support received from ACTED,” Mr. Arguel added.","Water Sanitation Hygiene"
"After rehabilitation of the borehole, ACTED conducted hygiene promotion sessions to improve the communities’ hygiene and sanitation practices with a focus on hand wash during critical times. Moreover, and to avoid such problems at community level in the future, ACTED revived and trained a Water User Committee, now in charge of carrying out maintenance activities such as generator set cleaning, minor repairs and securing water points. Mr. Arguel promised to regulate water consumption and help minimize wastage as well as ensure that the generator used to pump water is well maintained.","Water Sanitation Hygiene"

"Unchiprang has no access to ground water and needs an estimated 745,550 litres of water a day to be trucked in. The water table is falling and existing water sources are losing their capacity to meet the water needs of the rapidly expanding population. According to IOM water engineers, by January they may no longer be viable. ","Water Sanitation Hygiene"
"Before the August influx, IOM was also providing 240,000 litres of water daily for some 15,000 people living in Leda makeshift settlement. A total of 223 deep tube wells and 1,603 different types of latrine were also in place.","Water Sanitation Hygiene"
"But despite the earlier investment, WASH infrastructure in the settlements is now under immense strain due to the massive population increase in all sites.

Held in collaboration with the Federal Government of Somalia, the three-year project aims to reduce infant and child mortality caused by water borne diseases.","Water Sanitation Hygiene"
"Nearly 6.2 million people need humanitarian assistance in Somalia, due to the failure of consecutive rainy seasons and an ongoing conflict. The dire humanitarian situation has led to massive displacement and disease outbreaks. Many families have been forced to live in congested settlements for internally displaced persons (IDPs), often without basic services.","Water Sanitation Hygiene"
"This project strives to strengthen sustainable water solutions and increase the technical capacity of local administrations to operate and maintain water infrastructure. In line with the New Way of Working, it will address immediate water and sanitation needs while simultaneously building community resilience to withstand future drought and environmental related shocks.","Water Sanitation Hygiene"
"John Sifuma, Water and Sanitation Specialist from AfDB, said: “The Bank is responding to the challenge of supporting inclusive growth, and the transition to green growth, by scaling up investments and implementation of its ten-year strategy by focusing on five priority areas: Light up and power Africa; Feed Africa; Integrate Africa; Industrialize Africa and Improve quality of life for the people of Africa.”","Water Sanitation Hygiene"
"Sifuma added: “The project falls under the fifth priority and is aligned to Somalia’s National Development Plan. The Bank will continue working closely with the Federal Government of Somalia to support implementation of the government’s development agenda.”","Water Sanitation Hygiene"
"Acknowledging the strong collaboration between the government, IOM and AfDB, Somalia’s Minister for Energy and Water Resources Salimo Aloi Ibro said: “The ministry has worked closely with IOM and AfDB since the conceptualization of this project. We were involved in developing the concept note, project appraisals, and creation of all the key project documents. In the future, we are hoping that IOM and AfDB can help us scale up activities in Kismayo, Baidoa, Afgoye and Jowhar – places where the needs on the ground far outstretch available resources.”","Water Sanitation Hygiene"
"IOM Somalia Chief of Mission Dyane Epstein noted: “This project endeavours to improve the quality of life for an estimated 175,000 Somalis. As solutions to sustainable water provision and infrastructure are developed, other socio-economic activities will also flourish.

"In that time more than 7,000 people were relocated to 14 evacuation centres that Red Cross had helped set up on the east of Ambae Island, and now the decision has been made to evacuate Ambae’s entire population of more than 11,000 people to neighbouring islands Maewo, Pentecost and Santo.","Water Sanitation Hygiene"
"People are leaving with few possessions and there is no way of knowing when they will be able to return home.","Water Sanitation Hygiene"
"“Many people will have had to leave their home in a hurry and under fairly stressful circumstances so this will be a tough situation for them,” says Mr Tevi. “The most important thing will be ensuring the evacuees have access to food, water, and shelter.”","Water Sanitation Hygiene"
"Red Cross has been conducting assessments to get a clear picture of evacuees’ needs. Clean water has emerged as the most urgent requirement, something that will only increase as the evacuations off the island continue over the next week. In response, Red Cross has distributed thousands of litres of water to evacuees.","Water Sanitation Hygiene"

"While the Ebola crisis was at its peak, a small group of WASH entrepreneurs helped in a significant way by repairing hand pumps in clinics and other health facilities in some of the country’s hardest-hit counties. By restoring access to water — not only for drinking, but also for infection prevention and control — these WASH entrepreneurs ensured that facilities had the resources they needed to promote hand washing and safe hygiene practices that could help combat the spread of the disease.","Water Sanitation Hygiene"
"Liberia’s Bong, Lofa and Nimba counties were some of the areas most affected during the Ebola crisis. The communities in these counties are largely rural and hard to get to. Roads and infrastructure are poor and government services are limited. In these rural communities access to water and sanitation facilities are extreme challenges. According to the latest data from the [WHO/UNICEF Joint Monitoring Program for Water, Sanitation and Hygiene](http://www.unwater.org/new-publication-whounicef-joint-monitoring-programme-2017-report/), nearly 80 percent of rural Liberians do not have adequate sanitation facilities. At the same time, 47 percent of rural residents do not have safe, clean water sources.","Water Sanitation Hygiene"
"To tackle these issues, USAID launched the Integrated Water, Sanitation, and Hygiene (IWASH) program in 2010 which targeted communities in six counties and parts of Monrovia to improve water supply systems, sanitation facilities and hygiene practices. To increase water access, rather than just paying contractors to fix wells and pumps, Global Communities trained local entrepreneurs to fix them and to market their services to communities in the future.","Water Sanitation Hygiene"
"Through IWASH and ongoing PACS, more than 200 WASH entrepreneurs were recruited and trained to work closely with communities and increase the demand for and the use of WASH facilities and products.","Water Sanitation Hygiene"
"Entrepreneurs were trained in hand pump repair, hand-dug well construction and rehabilitation soap making, and latrine construction. In addition to providing these services, they also served as vendors for WASH-related equipment supplying local communities with materials needed to repair hand pumps and latrines. To help the entrepreneurs be successful, they also received training in key business topics including job costing, financial management, profit reinvestment and marketing.","Water Sanitation Hygiene"
"Once the WASH entrepreneurs had graduated they were introduced to their target communities. The entrepreneurs either served the communities where they were from or other nearby communities. This means they were familiar with the communities where they worked. As the Ebola crisis worsened and the need for WASH services grew, these locally-based entrepreneurs proved they were more cost-effective and able to more quickly access these clinics than pump mechanics from larger towns farther away.","Water Sanitation Hygiene"
"The entrepreneurs proved their effectiveness working very closely with humanitarian organizations and government counterparts to construct, rehabilitate and repair protected water sources in their rural communities. They went the extra mile into hard-to-reach areas and as a result of these efforts, community members have grown to trust in them. While the technical training and skills development of the entrepreneurs has been critical to their success, the long-lasting relationships they have built with the residents they serve has been equally important. These relationships built on cultural understanding, trust and friendship are contributing to the long-term sustainability and ownership of communal and individual WASH facilities within these communities.","Water Sanitation Hygiene"
"Esther Moye exemplifies that type of long-lasting relationships that WASH entrepreneurs have with their communities. She was one of the first WASH entrepreneurs trained under the IWASH program. In her small village of Maluquille, she began constructing latrines, repairing hand pumps and building wells. Despite being a woman, word of her skills got out and she received more contracts in neighboring districts to repair their WASH infrastructure. She describes how people would just stand around with their mouths open in disbelief as she made repairs.","Water Sanitation Hygiene"
"To date, Esther and her team have built or rehabilitated 40 wells in five districts throughout Bong County. In addition to her repair and construction skills, she has produced more than 14,000 bars of soap which she has sold to clinics, schools and communities to improve hygiene and encourage handwashing. Esther has also been very successful in promoting and selling WaterGuard — a chlorine solution for treating water so that it is safe for drinking. Esther and her team have been so successful that they decide to officially register their business. With this official registration, they can now solicit contracts from other entities like NGOs and private construction companies. In fact, they were just contracted by a private firm to construct three new hand dug wells fitted with hand pumps in three different districts.","Water Sanitation Hygiene"
"In her role as a successful technician and business woman, Esther is challenging traditional stereotypes. She explains how some people in the community have openly confessed to her that they never believed a woman could do such a great job. Esther is proud of her work as a WASH entrepreneur and example she is setting for her community and her family. The training “changed my life,” she says. “Before we were just making charcoal. Now I am able to support my family. I am able to buy clothes, food and register my children for school. I am also helping my community.”","Water Sanitation Hygiene"
"Having a well-trained cadre of WASH entrepreneurs offers promising potential to provide essential WASH services as Liberia recovers from Ebola and seeks to establish stronger and more sustainable health systems. By providing a market-based model for WASH services, gains made through infrastructure investments and health programming can continue to grow independently even after donor-funded programs are complete. WASH entrepreneurs have demonstrated success by providing localized and affordable services to communities typically left out of the WASH market and through continued training, formalization and investment, these entrepreneurs can better link community demand and private sector supply for WASH services in Liberia","Water Sanitation Hygiene"

"“There are only two dug wells in the village and most of the time, only one well is functional in all seasons. The last two decades had seen the villagers' dependency on water tankers increasing. The women of the village had to walk at least 1.5 km on the steep hills to bring water for domestic use.

"In 2000, the Rural Water Supply Division (RWSD), zila parishad (district council), a government agency executed a solar-power-based mini water supply scheme to improve the access of the villagers to drinking water. But, within one year of its implementation, the solar panels were stolen. Due to power failure, the villager’s water situation worsened. There was no other alternative for power supply. In 2011, RWSD took the initiative to implement it again.","Water Sanitation Hygiene"
"“On February 4, 2011, the scheme was technically sanctioned by the executive engineer, rural water supply division, Shweta Banerjee for Rs 49.33 lakh. On March 15, 2011, the RWSD commenced the work in the village. After overcoming the challenges in the implementation like procurement of solar pumps of 2.4KW (Kilowatt) and 80m head, fixation of power supply cable, etc. the scheme finally got commissioned on January 1, 2012,” says Kishor Raghuwanshi, subdivisional engineer, Maharashtra Jeevan Pradhikaran (MJP), a government agency.","Water Sanitation Hygiene"
"After the implementation of the solar scheme, the struggle for drinking water for the women of the village has almost come to an end.

"**In the rainforests of Beni Territory, families face life-threatening challenges—conflict, forced displacement, and outbreaks of disease**. Medair supports 12 health facilities in the region; without them, tens of thousands of people would have no viable way to receive medical care.","Water Sanitation Hygiene"
"Maintaining good hygiene and disinfection practices in these health clinics is essential to keeping vulnerable patients safe from new infections. Yet until recently, it was difficult to obtain enough chlorine for disinfection. The supply was unreliable, and the quality wasn’t always good.","Water Sanitation Hygiene"
"When chlorine is scarce, a clinic can become a high-risk area.  “Disinfection is very important, but the need is not always visible, especially as people cannot see with their own eyes when bacteria are killed,” said Yannick, Medair WASH project manager. ","Water Sanitation Hygiene"
"**Yannick proposed an innovative solution to the problem**. Instead of waiting for chlorine to be delivered, what if remote clinics could make their own chlorine? He began experimenting with small, solar-powered WATA kits, developed by the Swiss foundation Antenna Technologies, which convert easy-to-access kitchen salt and filtered water into chlorine through a process of electrolysis. Within hours, he was able to produce enough chlorine to disinfect an entire clinic. He soon began training clinic staff how to safely manufacture high-quality chlorine themselves. ","Water Sanitation Hygiene"
"“We can now produce our own chlorine at very low cost,” said Dr Jude, the Medical Director of Biakato-Mines clinic. “The supply is reliable, and the quality is good. We have become independent from suppliers and do not need to worry anymore; the chlorine is very strong and always at hand. Thanks to Medair, we can now provide a safe place for our patients always.” ","Water Sanitation Hygiene"
"**When a cholera outbreak struck the remote village of Mateka, five people died within three days, and 21 more became gravely ill**. Thankfully, Medair had set up a WATA kit at the health facility there months before, so that staff were able to quickly double the usual chlorine production, and use it to disinfect the treatment unit, along with all the water sources and houses in the whole village. Community health promotors explained how to prevent the disease from spreading, and set up handwashing stations with chlorinated water.","Water Sanitation Hygiene"
"Within two weeks, the outbreak was contained, and after five weeks, no more new cases of cholera were reported. “The WATA kit enabled the health facility team to respond quickly and appropriately,” said Yannick. “It also protected medical staff from being infected with the disease.”","Water Sanitation Hygiene"
"Solar-powered chlorine production is a small but game-changing innovation being put into practice by the Medair WASH team and their local partners. We are exploring its use for treating drinking water in emergencies as well. ","Water Sanitation Hygiene"

"*One limitation of the WATA kit is that the solution has a concentration of 0.6 percent active chlorine, whereas on some occasions, such as during a disease outbreak, a 2.0 percent solution is needed for a few special purposes such as disinfecting certain areas of the treatment unit. In response, Medair uses a box of highly concentrated chlorine powder and has trained staff how to use this to supplement the WATA kit. Chlorine produced by the WATA kit is sufficient for ordinary clinic conditions.*","Water Sanitation Hygiene"
"For Maban, the epicenter of Sudanese refugees, health related issues are one of the greatest fears worrying the local population and humanitarian actors. This fear was worsened with the declaration of cholera earlier this year in parts of the country. ACTED as the water and sanitation and hygiene lead actor in Doro, Kaya and Gendrassa Camps in Maban, took swift action to avert any chances of a break out in the camps and to minimise the risk of diseases.

"Three years after experiencing the destruction caused by typhoon Haiyan, ACTED deployed enumerators to assess the current situation of families in Eastern Samar.","Water Sanitation Hygiene"
"Looking back at the situation, massive destruction caused by super typhoon Haiyan left terrible devastation throughout Eastern Samar. It was a wakeup call for not just Eastern Samar, but the whole of Philippines, to be more prepared and resilient for any catastrophic disaster. It also brought home a strong message to be more responsible in protecting our environment, which will ultimately protect people, livelihoods, homes and infrastructure.","Water Sanitation Hygiene"
"ACTED is continuing its commitment to improve the living conditions of families through health and sanitation projects in Eastern Samar. With this, ACTED deployed a group of enumerators to conduct a faecal sludge management assessment in four core areas; namely Guiuan, Mercedes, Salcedo and Quinapondan. In order to ensure the relevance of the project and participation of the beneficiaries, an interview was conducted with Ms. Joana to share her views on the issue of latrines and septic tank in her current situation.","Water Sanitation Hygiene"

"**Julie’s toilet facility situation after two years of WASH implementation**","Water Sanitation Hygiene"
"Super Typhoon Haiyan, one of the strongest typhoons to hit the Philippines on November 8th, 2013 caused severe damage in terms of shelter, livelihood, water, sanitation and hygiene in Eastern Visayas. Three years on, ACTED returns to assess the families affected and reflects the progress made in terms on sanitation.","Water Sanitation Hygiene"
"Julie is a full time mother of two young children under the age of 5 and four older children between the ages of 6 to 17. Her husband generates an income for the family through fishing and shell crafting. The family, together with their grandmother, live in a cramped house in Barangay Ngolos, Eastern Samar, with a small kitchen annex in poor hygiene and sanitation condition.","Water Sanitation Hygiene"
"The devastating effects of Typhoon Haiyan in 2013 and the fear of another such typhoon hitting in the future still looms heavily with the family. Although it is dangerous and technically not permitted to live 40m near the seashore, Julie and her family have no choice. They have been given notice from the owner of the private land they currently reside on to transfer their house, together with the toilet facility located outside the main house, to another area. Their only option is to relocate nearer the seashore. The lack of sanitation infrastructure in the new relocation site is worrying for Julie, especially the effect it will have on her children’s health.","Water Sanitation Hygiene"
"Julie was one of the beneficiaries of ACTED during the previous WASH project implemented from 2014 to 2015, which targeted almost 60,000 individuals across five municipalities in Eastern Samar. She received one toilet bowl, 14 concrete hollow blocks and two CGI’s for the construction of a toilet. However, there remain certain gaps in the construction of a ‘good sanitation facility’, namely additional material is required to strengthen the roof and door.","Water Sanitation Hygiene"
"Since construction of the toilet facility, almost two years now, the septic tank has not reached its maximum capacity. However neighbouring households, who have septic tanks made out of blue drums, have reached maximum capacity. When the maximum capacity of the septic tank is reached, Julie’s plan is to either utilise the neighbours’ toilet facility (especially those who were able construct a second tank) or go back into the bush if badly needed – a worrying alternative.","Water Sanitation Hygiene"
"As Julie and her family have benefitted from having their own toilet facility the last two years, she assures that constructing a new toilet with septic tank will be prioritised when moving to the new site. Julia stated that having a toilet “is not only for our heath but for the safety of my 6 children, especially my daughters”. However she added that they will no longer create a septic tank made up of blue drums because it is not sustainable, instead they will continue to create a concrete facility. She does not want to be in the same situation as her neighbours, who currently face the issue of a full septic tank.","Water Sanitation Hygiene"
"“I just got the Malabanan service last year in the middle of September for the desludging of our septic tank”,- Maria’s statement after being asked if she heard about the Malabanan service provider.","Water Sanitation Hygiene"
"Maria, a 48 years old public servant has been living for the past 10 years in Barangay 2, Quinapondan with her four grandchildren. However, she is currently left alone at home as her grandchildren attend school in another town. Maria does all regular tasks on her own, such as cooking, washing clothes and cleaning the house, especially the toilet room to ensure good hygiene and sanitation.","Water Sanitation Hygiene"
"During the conversation, Maria mentioned that she enlisted the Malabanan service because she was anxious during the previous town fiesta that the septic tank might leak and bring a foul smell to her visitors. However she does not feel like she benefited from the service, in accordance to her expectations, as the septic tank was filled with water after being desludged due to its location near an irrigation system. “It did not turn out to be successful because of the location of my septic tank”- Maria stated.","Water Sanitation Hygiene"
"Enlisting Malabanan’s services cost Maria one thousand and four hundred Philippine peso to be exact. It took only an hour for the desludging of the septic tank using a machine and truck. Since Maria’s toilet has only 1 chamber over hanging the pit latrine, the Malabanan group had to make a hole at the side of the toilet facility to be able to desludge the tank. This hole was then rehabilitated after the desludging was complete.","Water Sanitation Hygiene"
"At this time, Maria is still using her toilet facility since it is still functional; however she plans to add a new chamber to the septic tank so it will become bigger and will last longer before filling up again.","Water Sanitation Hygiene"

"Climate change is already forcing millions of people from their land and homes, and putting many more at risk of displacement in the future. Supercharged storms, more intense and prolonged droughts, rising seas and other impacts of climate change all exacerbate people’s existing vulnerabilities and increase the likelihood of being forced to move.","Climate Change and Environment"
"While climate change affects us all, the risks of displacement are significantly higher in lower-income countries and among people living in poverty. Oxfam’s analysis reveals that between 2008 and 2016, people in low- and lower-middle income countries were around five times more likely than people in high-income countries to be displaced by sudden-onset extreme weather disasters. Women, children, indigenous peoples and other vulnerable groups are also disproportionately affected.","Climate Change and Environment"
"The loss of homes, livelihoods and ancestral lands through displacement epitomizes the human cost and the grave injustice of climate change. Those least responsible for climate change are bearing the brunt of its impacts, and have fewest resources to cope with these new realities. The disproportionate incidence and impact of climate change related displacement both stems from and further drives inequality.","Climate Change and Environment"
"Displacement is disruptive and traumatic. However, much can and must be done to minimize the risk of displacement linked to climate change, and to guarantee rights and protection for people who are forced to move.","Climate Change and Environment"
"A first priority must be far more rapid reductions in global climate pollution, in line with limiting warming to 1.5°C. At the same time, communities must be supported to build resilience to the impacts of climate change that can no longer be avoided.  ","Climate Change and Environment"
"Developed countries in particular must rapidly accelerate the decarbonization of their economies. They must also increase the scale and accessibility of support to enable developing countries to transition to a 100 percent renewable energy future and adapt to the impacts of climate change. At the 2017 UN Climate Change Conference (COP23), governments must recommit to the goals of the Paris Agreement and substantially strengthen international action and cooperation towards ending climate pollution and building resilient communities.","Climate Change and Environment"
"While recognizing that all possible measures must be taken to avoid displacement, it is also necessary to support strategies to ensure that people who are forced to move in the future can do so safely, with dignity, and on their own terms. The negotiation by September 2018 of two new Global Compacts – one on safe, orderly and regular migration, and one on refugees – offers a critical opportunity to help ensure safety, dignity and lasting solutions for those who are displaced, or at risk of displacement, in the context of climate change.

"As India’s financial capital, Mumbai, reeled under swirling floodwaters in August after it was lashed with more rain in 12 hours than it receives in two weeks, the inevitable question followed: Are such events being increasingly triggered by climate change?","Climate Change and Environment"
"A new study gives an answer. It says extreme rainfall events that lead to widespread flooding, and have risen threefold across a vast swath of Central India since 1950, are the result of rapid warming of the Arabian Sea.","Climate Change and Environment"
"The bad news is that they could increase in frequency as climate change continues to warm the oceans. The good news is that these events could become more predictable as they are linked to rising sea temperatures according to the study.","Climate Change and Environment"
"“A moisture surge from the Arabian Sea over the Indian landmass is one of the major culprits for huge increase in widespread extreme rainfall,” said Professor Subimal Ghosh at the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Mumbai, who was involved in the study.","Climate Change and Environment"
"In recent years, the frequency of flash floods that kill hundreds, displace millions, cause urban flooding and leave farmland inundated have increased in India even in areas where monsoon winds have been bringing less rain. Central India is one of the hardest hit areas.","Climate Change and Environment"
"In the last two months, Mumbai, a coastal city lying off the Arabian Sea, was not the only place to experience extreme rainfall, several parts of neighboring Gujarat state coped with torrential rain in short spells and the countryside was also hit by flooding.","Climate Change and Environment"
"One of the dominant factors warming the Arabian Sea is increased carbon emissions. But its temperatures are rising more because unlike the Pacific and the Atlantic, it is land-locked in the north, which causes a lot of extra heat because of global warming to be trapped in the basin, according to Roxy Mathew Koll, co-author of the study.","Climate Change and Environment"
"The study was conducted by scientists from the Pune-based Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology, IIT, Mumbai, and University of Maryland, USA.","Climate Change and Environment"
"Pointing to the need for refining forecasting methods, the study said the warmest ocean temperatures appear two to three weeks before the event, giving an opportunity for better warnings.","Climate Change and Environment"
"Koll said these events are predictable a week in advance so that the public is alerted and precautionary measures can be taken. For example, schools and offices could be shut and people in low lying areas moved to higher ones.","Climate Change and Environment"

"“With what we have witnessed just recently with the passage of hurricanes Harvey, Irma and now Maria, I cannot underscore sufficiently the importance the Bahamas attaches to combating climate change, and the preservation and protection of the environment,” he said.","Climate Change and Environment"
"Stressing that “climate change is global,” he emphasised the damage that hurricane Irma had in the Bahamian archipelago. Indeed, while the Bahamas had not suffered a direct hit, it was not totally spaced. The southern islands experienced serious damage. Additionally, tornadoes inflicted considerable damage on the northern islands of Bimini and Grand Bahama.","Climate Change and Environment"
"Highlighting the election of a new Government for his country the past May, the Minister spoke on its intention of creating the first fully green island in the region, out of the destruction of Ragged Island, which became uninhabitable.","Climate Change and Environment"
"“For the first time in its history, The Bahamas evacuated whole communities to safe quadrants ahead of Hurricane Irma. What’s next: wholesale evacuation of the entire Caribbean?” he asked, calling on the international community to act fast and in a co-ordinated way.","Climate Change and Environment"
"In his address, the Foreign Minister also highlighted the “need to re-evaluate of the measurements used to determine economic well-being” in the country, to allow them to receive development assistant.","Climate Change and Environment"

"As India’s financial capital, Mumbai, reeled under swirling floodwaters in August after it was lashed with more rain in 12 hours than it receives in two weeks, the inevitable question followed: Are such events being increasingly triggered by climate change?","Climate Change and Environment"
"A new study gives an answer. It says extreme rainfall events that lead to widespread flooding, and have risen threefold across a vast swath of Central India since 1950, are the result of rapid warming of the Arabian Sea.","Climate Change and Environment"
"The bad news is that they could increase in frequency as climate change continues to warm the oceans. The good news is that these events could become more predictable as they are linked to rising sea temperatures according to the study.","Climate Change and Environment"
"“A moisture surge from the Arabian Sea over the Indian landmass is one of the major culprits for huge increase in widespread extreme rainfall,” said Professor Subimal Ghosh at the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Mumbai, who was involved in the study.","Climate Change and Environment"
"In recent years, the frequency of flash floods that kill hundreds, displace millions, cause urban flooding and leave farmland inundated have increased in India even in areas where monsoon winds have been bringing less rain. Central India is one of the hardest hit areas.","Climate Change and Environment"
"In the last two months, Mumbai, a coastal city lying off the Arabian Sea, was not the only place to experience extreme rainfall, several parts of neighboring Gujarat state coped with torrential rain in short spells and the countryside was also hit by flooding.","Climate Change and Environment"
"One of the dominant factors warming the Arabian Sea is increased carbon emissions. But its temperatures are rising more because unlike the Pacific and the Atlantic, it is land-locked in the north, which causes a lot of extra heat because of global warming to be trapped in the basin, according to Roxy Mathew Koll, co-author of the study.","Climate Change and Environment"
"The study was conducted by scientists from the Pune-based Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology, IIT, Mumbai, and University of Maryland, USA.","Climate Change and Environment"
"Pointing to the need for refining forecasting methods, the study said the warmest ocean temperatures appear two to three weeks before the event, giving an opportunity for better warnings.","Climate Change and Environment"
"Koll said these events are predictable a week in advance so that the public is alerted and precautionary measures can be taken. For example, schools and offices could be shut and people in low lying areas moved to higher ones.","Climate Change and Environment"
"According to the study, there were 268 floods in India between 1950 and 2015, killing almost 70,000 people and leaving about 17 million homeless.","Climate Change and Environment"
"A study by the International Monetary Fund this month said countries in the tropics, which include India, will be hit hardest by global warming.","Climate Change and Environment"
"Such concerns are shared by environmentalists in India, who have been highlighting the urgent need to tackle global warming.","Climate Change and Environment"
"India is more vulnerable not only because it is more exposed to climate change, but because it lacks adequate coping mechanisms according to Vijeta Rattani from New Delhi’s Center of Science and Environment. “For example it does not have the technology of better forecasting, it does not have proper relief and rescue mechanisms in place,” she said. “The main crunch is money, already states are struggling for resources for climate and environment factors.”","Climate Change and Environment"
"- The Government of Kenya has declared the country’s drought a national emergency.   ","Climate Change and Environment"
"- The areas with the lowest rainfall in this drought are in the northwest and southeast parts of the country.   ","Climate Change and Environment"
"- Scientists with World Weather Attribution used multiple methods of attribution science to look at the possible roles climate change and the ENSO signal played in the drought.     ","Climate Change and Environment"
"- Trends indicate that the temperatures involved in this drought are hotter than they would have been without the influence of climate change.     ","Climate Change and Environment"
"- There is no detectable trend in rainfall, but the team cannot exclude small changes in the risk of poor rains linked to climate change.","Climate Change and Environment"
"For Kenyans, the distressing numbers in association with the ongoing drought continue to mount. As of February 2017, the drought has affected 23 of 47 counties. The cost of maize has risen by a third[1] in the past year, while production of the staple crop has plunged. More than two million people are in need of food aid. Estimates of severely malnourished pregnant mothers and children have topped 350,000. Approximately 175,000 children are unable to attend pre-primary and primary schools due to the drought, according to a UNICEF estimate[2]. On February 10th, 2017, Kenya’s President Uhuru Kenyatta declared a national emergency. And on March 9th, the president called for the temporary closing of schools in drought-stricken areas.","Climate Change and Environment"
"The indications of the impending drought began in 2016. Kenya receives the majority of its rainfall during two periods: the “long rains” from March, April and May (MAM) and the “short rains” from October, November and December (OND). However, in 2016 the OND rains failed. Counties in the northwest and southeast regions were particularly badly hit. The southeast also suffered from poor MAM rains.","Climate Change and Environment"
